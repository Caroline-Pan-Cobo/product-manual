(Optional) Add a transaction category and description to identify this transfer more easily.
  - For **Category**, either create a new category or select from existing ones. Each transfer can be associated with a maximum of 5 categories. Note that once a category is added, it cannot be edited or deleted. Currently, Cobo Portal allows the creation of up to 200 categories.
      - To view the categories under your organization, click the profile icon in the bottom left corner, then select **Organization** > **Transaction Categories**.
  - For **Description**, add a description with a maximum limit of 100 characters.
