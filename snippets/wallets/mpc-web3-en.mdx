In practice, Web3 Wallets and MPC Wallets support most of the same features, and their capabilities for asset transfer and management are largely equivalent. The main differences are summarized below:

| Category | Web3 Wallets | MPC Wallets |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Use cases | Web3 operations without key custody | Advanced custody scenarios that require higher control |
| Key ownership | Fully managed by Cobo | Users hold private key shares in a distributed model |
