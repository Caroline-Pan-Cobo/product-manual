### Set up governance policies and user roles
<Note>If you're in the testing phase and want to quickly verify deposits and withdrawals first, you can skip this section for now and set them up later.</Note>

<Accordion title="Set up governance policies and user roles">
Setting up [governance policies](/en/portal/organization/governance-intro) and [user roles](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) is essential for managing access control and security in your organization. Governance policies define approval rules for operations, using mechanisms like auto-approval, auto-rejection, and approval quorum across different aspects (e.g. deleting a member, freezing the organization, and managing the API keys). User roles are preset combinations of these governance policies, determining what actions each member can perform.

For example, by [editing the governance policy](/en/portal/organization/governance-edit) for member deletion, you can require an approval quorum of at least 2 members who have either the [Admin or Manager role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions). This means the member deletion operation will only be executed after receiving approvals from 2 or more qualified approvers.

When [assigning user roles to a member](/en/portal/organization/assign-roles-to-members), you can either use the [preset user roles](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) provided by Cobo or [create your own customized roles](/en/portal/organization/create-customized-roles).

### Invite members
   1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
      * For testing purposes, use the [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
      * For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
   2. Click the profile icon at the bottom left, and then click **Organization**.
   3. Click **Members**. On the **Members** page, click **Invite Members**.
   4. Enter the member's email address and name, and then select appropriate [user roles](/en/portal/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets#set-up-governance-policies-and-user-roles).
   <Note>Confirm on Cobo Guard that this invitation was initiated by you. Also, as a default security policy, at least half of your [organization admins](/en/portal/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets#set-up-governance-policies-and-user-roles) must approve the invitation request on Cobo Guard.</Note>

   After receiving the invitation, new members will need to:
   1. Use the activation link in the invitation email to create their Cobo Portal account.
   2. Set up Cobo Guard by:
      * Logging in to Cobo Portal (using the same environment as the organization).
      * Clicking **Guide** at the bottom left, then clicking **Set up Cobo Guard**.
      * Following the on-screen instructions to install Cobo Guard on their iOS device and linking it to their account.
