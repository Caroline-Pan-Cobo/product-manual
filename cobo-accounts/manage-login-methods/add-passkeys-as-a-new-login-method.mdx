title: "Add passkeys as a new login method"
---


_Passkeys provide an additional layer of security, effectively protecting against a range of threats, notably phishing attacks. Moreover, passkeys serve as a login option that allows you to skip MFA verification if it is enabled. This convenience stems from the fact that MFA verification aims to confirm your ownership of the specific device, aligning with the authentication purpose of passkeys._

1) Log in to Cobo Accounts and click on **Login Methods** in the main menu on the left hand side.
2) Click on **Create Passkey** next to passkeys.
3) Choose your preferred method to create a passkey for your Cobo Accounts.
4) If required, complete an MFA verification.
5) You can review the details of your newly added passkey, including its creation time and the last time it was used.
