_Note: Passkeys are an easier and more secure alternative to passwords. Once you create a passkey, you can use it for logging into Cobo Accounts through fingerprint, face scan, or screen lock (PIN code). For more information on how to add passkeys as a login method, please refer to the **Manage login methods** section._

1) Switch to the **Log In** tab.
2) Click on **Passkey**.
3) Use your Passkey to confirm your identity.
