title: "Use passkeys for login"
---

Note: Passkeys are an easier and more secure alternative to passwords. Once you create a passkey, you can use it for logging into Cobo Accounts through fingerprint, face scan, or screen lock (PIN code). See [**Manage login methods**](/cobo-accounts/manage-login-methods) for instructions on how to add passkeys as a login method.

1) Switch to the **Log In** tab.
2) Click **Passkey**.
3) Use your Passkey to confirm your identity.
