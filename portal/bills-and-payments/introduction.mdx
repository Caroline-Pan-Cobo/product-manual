Cobo offers various pricing plans tailored to your special business requirements. Each plan includes predefined usage quotas, such as the maximum number of addresses you can create, the supported chains, and the maximum volume of assets you can store under Coboâ€™s services, among others.

Once you reach a usage limit, you will need to pay overage charges for any usage exceeding the limit at the corresponding unit price. In such cases, you have the option to purchase add-on usages at a discounted rate or upgrade to a higher-tier plan.
