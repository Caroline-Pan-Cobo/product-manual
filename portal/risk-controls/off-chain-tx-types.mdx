Currently, Cobo Portal supports two types of off-chain transaction policies:

**Transfer**: Applicable to regular token transfers.<br/>
**Contract Call**: Applicable to transactions involving smart contract calls.<br/>

Each organization manages a list of transaction policies. When a transaction is initiated, it undergoes a matching process against the ordered policies in the list. If a matching policy is identified, the corresponding preset action will be executed, potentially resulting in auto approval, auto rejection, or the activation of an approval quorum.
