## What are risk controls?

On Cobo Portal, risk controls encompass a set of strategies tailored to managing and mitigating risks associated with digital asset transactions and custody. These controls are executed through three distinct methods:

1. [Transaction policies](/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-types): You can select from one type of on-chain transaction policy and two types of off-chain transaction policies, each designed to ensure comprehensive risk controls. Furthermore, the implementation of tailored approval actions, such as auto approval and auto rejection, serves to optimize workflow efficiency.

2. [Governance policies](/portal/organization/governance-intro): You can define the number of organization admins required to review certain operations, such as deleting a team member or freezing an organization. Moreover, you can implement customized approval actions, including auto approval and auto rejection.

3. [User roles and permissions](/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions): You can assign specific roles to designated team members. Currently, Cobo Portal provides five preset roles, with the flexibility to create additional roles to tailor to your specific requirements.
