## Configure user roles and permissions

Cobo Portal offers extensive role-based access control capabilities for you to segregate duties and safeguard your assets and operations.

By assigning roles to your team members, they will be granted permissions associated with that role, governing which parts of the platform they can access and what operations they can perform. Cobo Portal offers preset user roles, such as Admin, Approver, Spender, and Viewer. Alternatively, you can also customize your own roles to suit your unique business needs.

To view preset roles and/or create customized roles, click **Organization** > **Roles**.

For details, refer to the [**Organization**](/portal/organization/introduction) user manual.


## Configure off-chain transaction policies

Currently, Cobo Portal supports three distinct types of off-chain transaction policies: transfer policies, contract call policies, and message signing policies. Each policy is meticulously crafted to ensure thorough off-chain risk controls. Additionally, the implementation of customized approval actions, including auto approval and auto rejection, helps further enhance your workflow efficiency.

For details, refer to the [**Off-chain transaction policies**](/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-types) section.
