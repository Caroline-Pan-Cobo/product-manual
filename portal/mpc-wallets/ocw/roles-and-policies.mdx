## Configure user roles and permissions

Cobo Portal offers extensive role-based access control capabilities for you to segregate duties and safeguard your assets and operations.

By assigning roles to your team members, they will be granted permissions associated with that role, governing which parts of the platform they can access and what operations they can perform. Cobo Portal offers preset user roles, such as Admin, Approver, Spender, Viewer. Alternatively, you can also customize your own roles to suit your unique business needs.

Before executing any transaction or operation, a thorough verification of user roles and permissions will be conducted to ensure utmost security.

To configure the permissions associated with each role, click **Organization** > **Organization Settings** > **Roles**.

## Configure transaction policies

When initiating a transfer or contract interaction with your MPC Wallet, you can set up an extensive variety of programmable transaction policies on virtually any parameter within a transaction or operation to ensure its utmost security via Cobo Portalâ€™s **Transaction Policies**.

Automate governance by configuring a set of granular rules that dictate how transactions are handled and approved for every wallet, user, and transaction type. You can create address whitelists and/or blacklists, set transfer limits for a single transaction or specific time periods, configure approval workflows, and control how transactions and operations are automatically processed - rejected, approved, or subject to specific quorum requirements.

To view the transaction policies associated with your wallet, click **View Transaction Policies** in the respective wallet.
