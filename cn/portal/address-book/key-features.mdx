## Address Manager
Create a list of addresses for easy access, eliminating error-prone manual entry during transactions. Locate your addresses quickly by adding customizable labels (up to 30 characters) to each address, using the search bar, sorting, or applying filters based on networks or last modified time.

## Comprehensive Audit Trail
Track and review detailed operation log (e.g. who added the address, when it was added or modified, etc) as well as the transaction history associated with each address.

## Permission-based Access
Manage permissions to add, view, edit, and delete addresses in your Address Book based on user roles. Refer to [**Organization - User roles and permissions**](/cn/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) for further details.

## Transfer Restrictions
Easily select addresses from your Address Book when you configure risk policies in [**Risk Controls**](/cn/portal/risk-controls/introduction), such as whitelisting or setting transfer limits.
