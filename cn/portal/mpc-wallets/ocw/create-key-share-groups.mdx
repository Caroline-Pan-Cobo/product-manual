After creating a vault, you now need to create key share groups. There are 3 types of key share groups: Main Group, Signing Group, and Recovery Group.


|                        | Main Group | Signing Group | Recovery Group |
|------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Primary Purposes       | <ol><li>Create Signing Groups and Recovery Groups</li><li>Sign transactions, if you have not created Signing Groups</li></ol> | Sign transactions | <ol><li>Create a new Main Group, if your Main Group and the backup copy are lost or compromised</li><li>Recover the whole private key</li></ol>
| Required / Optional    | Required | Optional | Optional
| Max Quantity per Vault | 1 | 1 or more | 1 (recommended) or more


## Main Group
Creating a Main Group is mandatory before you can create an MPC wallet. You may begin to use the MPC Wallet once the Main Group is successfully created. As best security practices and to ensure the utmost safety for your assets, it is a good idea to set up your Signing Group and Recovery Group as soon as you can, and back up all key share groups. You can create multiple Signing Groups to cater to your business requirements, but it is recommended to create only one Recovery Group. (Best security practices for your key share groups available soon on our Developer Hub.)

### Create a Main Group <a id="create-a-main-group"></a>
When creating the Main Group for your MPC vault, you have the option to choose either mobile co-signer or API co-signer. Make sure you understand the primary purposes and prerequisites of each co-signer type in the table below before proceeding further.


<a id="signer-type"></a>
|        Co-Signer Type     | Mobile Co-Signer | API Co-Signer |
|------------------------|------------|-------------|
| Primary Purposes       | The mobile co-signer is a team member who is assigned to securely sign transactions initiated through the Cobo Portal. Their TSS Node ID is generated by their Cobo Guard app and will be automatically filled. | The API co-signer is a server node which is used to automatically sign transactions initiated through the API. Its TSS Node ID is generated using the provided TSS Node software package and must be done before setting up the wallet. See TSS Node Technical Setup for further instructions. |
| Prerequisite Steps     | Your chosen key share holders need to: <ol><li>[Download Cobo Guard](/cn/guard/download).</li><li> [Set up Cobo Guard as a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method of their Cobo Accounts](/cn/accounts/set-up-mfa#set-up-cobo-guard).</li><li> Be [added to your organization as a member](/cn/portal/organization/manage-members).</li></ol> | Your chosen key share holders need to provide you with their generated TSS node ID. (TSS Node technical setup guide available soon on our Developer Hub.)|

After you've chosen a co-signer type and set up the prerequisites, follow the instructions below to create a Main Group. **Note:** Only the users who have been assigned [the Operator user role in the organization](/cn/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) can create a Main Group.


1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click **Create Main Group** under the vault name.
<img src="/images/mpc-wallet/create-main-key-group.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>
4. On the **Create Main Group** dialog, navigate to the **Key Share Holder 2** section, and then complete the following configurations: <a id="on-the-create-main-group-dialog"></a>
    - To use **Mobile Co-Signer**, select a **Holder** (the **TSS Node ID** will be filled in automatically), then click **Confirm**.
    - To use **API Co-Signer**, enter a **Holder** name, fill in the **TSS Node ID** generated using the TSS Node software package, then click **Confirm**. (TSS Node technical setup guide available soon on our Developer Hub).
5. The status will show “Pending Key Share Holder Confirmation”. Inform the relevant key share holder to confirm on their end. See [Generate and back up your key shares](/cn/guard/generate-and-back-up-key-shares) for instructions on how key share holders can complete this confirmation process.
    - **Notes:**
        - If using mobile co-signer, the key share holder will receive a message on Cobo Guard and they will have 24 hours to complete the confirmation process.
        - If using API co-signer, ensure to bring the TSS Node online within 24 hours. The confirmation process is completed as soon as the TSS Node goes online.

6. Once the key share holder has confirmed on their end, the key generation process will begin.

7. Once the key generation process is complete, the **Status** will show as **Active**. **Note:** a default wallet will be automatically created for this vault upon successful key generation.

## Signing Group
Signing Groups are created using the Main Group. You can create multiple Signing Groups for different members depending on your business needs.

### Create a Signing Group
Similar to creating the Main Group, you have the option to choose either mobile co-signer or API co-signer when creating the Signing Group. Make sure you understand [the primary purposes and prerequisites of each co-signer type](#signer-type) before proceeding further.


After you've chosen a co-signer type and set up the prerequisites, follow the instructions below to create a Signing Group. **Note:** Only the users who have been assigned [the Operator user role in the organization](/cn/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) can create a Signing Group.


1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.

4. In the **Key Group Management** page, click **Signing Groups** > **Create Signing Group**.

<img src="/images/mpc-wallet/create-signing-group.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>

5. The Signing Group creation process is the same as the Main Group creation process. See [Create Main Group](/cn/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-key-share-groups#on-the-create-main-group-dialog) for detailed instructions.

### Manage Signing Group
#### Convert Signing Group into Main Group
In certain situations, you may want to convert a Signing Group into the Main Group. For example, if the current owner of the Main Group is leaving the organization and you need to assign a new person to own the Main Group, you may choose to convert a specific Signing Group into the new Main Group.

Follow the instructions below to convert a Signing Group into a Main Group.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
