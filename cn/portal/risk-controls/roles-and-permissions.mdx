User roles consist of predefined sets of rules that allow you to assign specific permissions to designated members within your organization. Cobo offers five preset roles, and you can also create additional roles tailored to your specific requirements. See [**User roles and permissions**](/cn/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) for more information.
