You can set up governance policies to define the number of team members needed to approve certain operations (e.g., delete a team member, modify member roles, freeze the organization). Depending on the operation, the default rule mandates approvals from at least 50% of the admins or approval by one of the admins. You can also manually edit the rule to be auto approval, auto rejection, approval quorum, or customized workflow. See [**Governance policies**](/cn/portal/organization/governance-intro) for more information.
