1. Navigate to the **Transfer Settings** tab.
2. Under Whitelist Addresses, click **Add address now** or **Add**.
3. Enter the target address where you want to receive tokens.
4. Select one or more tokens that can be transferred to the target address.
5. To add another whitelist address and its associated tokens, click **+Add address and token group** > **Continue**.
6. Review your transfer whitelists and their associated tokens.
7. Adding new transfer whitelists will require adjustments to the Authorizer contract, and a multi-sig confirmation from Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; owners is required.
    - If you wish to let Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; owners review one or more requests in a batch, click **+Add to Transaction Bundle**.
    - If you prefer Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; owners to review this single request, click **Submit** instead.
8. Your transfer whitelists will take effect once the multi-sig confirmation is complete. Note that your delegate is only able to withdraw the authorized tokens to addresses listed in the transfer whitelists.
