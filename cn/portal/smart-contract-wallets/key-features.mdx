## Efficient single-signature fund transfers
Effortlessly execute fund transfers via a single-signature scheme, representing a boost in efficiency from the multi-signature scheme when utilizing Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.

## Web3 access via Cobo Connect
Seamlessly interact with Web3 applications using Cobo Connect, a browser extension compatible with the Cobo Portal wallets.

## Off-chain and on-chain transaction policies
Exercise full control over transaction policies for your Smart Contract Wallets, extending beyond off-chain to cover on-chain transaction policies. With off-chain transaction policies, ensure comprehensive security by setting up configurable transfer policies and transaction-signing policies. With on-chain transaction policies, authorize specific actions to be safely executed by delegates, who can then sign these actions using a simple single-signature transaction.
