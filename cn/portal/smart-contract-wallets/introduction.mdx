## What are Smart Contract Wallets?

Cobo's Smart Contract Wallets support a myriad of smart contract wallets, prominently featuring [Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;](https://safe.global/wallet) alongside other Account Abstraction-based smart wallets. At the heart of our initial launch lies the robust integration of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; with Cobo Safe, an adaptable role-based access control framework boasting unparalleled authorization customization. Seamlessly embedded as a plugin for Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;, the foremost multi-signature wallet across EVM chains, Cobo Safe provides unmatched access control. Delving deeper within the Smart Contract Wallets lies the flexibility to delegate EOA wallets such as Cobo’s Custodial Web3 Wallets or MPC Organization-Controlled Wallets to interact seamlessly with the smart contract ecosystem.
