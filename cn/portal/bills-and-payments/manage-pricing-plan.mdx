## View your pricing plans

To view the pricing plans you are currently using, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click the profile icon at the bottom left, and choose **Pricing Plans**. 
3. Select a product to see the corresponding pricing plan.

It is recommended that you purchase add-on usages or upgrade to a higher-tier plan when one or more usages are nearing their limits. This will ensure uninterrupted service and avoid any potential disruptions or overage charges.

## Upgrade a pricing plan

To upgrade a pricing plan, follow the steps as introduced in [Purchase a pricing plan](/cn/portal/bills-and-payments/purchase-pricing-plan).

There are a few additional considerations based on the specific upgrade scenario:

- If you are upgrading to an Enterprise plan, you will need to contact the sales team to review and sign the service agreement. For Custodial Wallets or MPC wallets, you will also be required to complete KYC verification, if you have not done so in previous purchases.
- If you want to adjust your existing Enterprise plan, you will need to contact the sales team to review and sign the service agreement.

## Purchase add-on usages

Add-on usages will be used to offset any usage exceeding your pricing plan quota immediately after the purchase. 

To purchase add-on usages, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click the profile icon at the bottom left, and choose **Pricing Plans**. 
3. Select the product for which you want to purchase add-on usages.
4. Select the item for which you want to purchase add-on usages, and click **Buy More**.
5. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the purchase. In particular, you can click **Subscribe** to set up an automatic renewal of the add-on usage, or click **Pay** to make a one-time payment.

**Notes:**

- You can purchase multiple add-on usages of the same type. The deduction rules are as follows:	
  - The usage that expires first is deducted first. If the expiration dates are the same, the deduction is based on the time of order placement, with the earlier order being deducted first.
  - After all add-on usages have been deducted, any remaining excess usage will be subject to overage charges calculated at the corresponding unit price.
- Add-on usages cannot be used for deductions beyond the expiration date. To avoid increased costs or business impact, it is recommended that you promptly purchase additional add-on usages when the current ones are running out.
