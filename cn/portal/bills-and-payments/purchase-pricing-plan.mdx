You must purchase a pricing plan prior to using Custodial Wallets or Exchange Wallets. For MPC Wallets and Smart Contract Wallets, a 14-day free trial period is available, and you will need to purchase a pricing plan once your free trial reaches the expiration date or the free trial's usage limit is met.

## Prerequisites

1. Before you purchase an Enterprise plan, reach out to the sales team who will assist you in finding a custom plan that best suits your needs.
2. If you are purchasing an Enterprise plan for Custodial Wallets or MPC Wallets, you will be asked to apply for Know Your Customer (KYC) verification during the purchase process. The following are a few example documents and information you might need to provide during the application. For details, refer to KYC verification.
   - Your company information, such as your company name and registered address.
   - Company documents, such as certified copies of the company's certificate of incorporation and articles of association.
   - Shareholder or Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) information.

## Procedures

Follow the steps below to purchase a pricing plan.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click the profile icon at the bottom left, and choose **Pricing Plans**. 
3. Select a product. **Note:** If you want to use multiple products, you need to purchase a separate plan for each individual product.
4. Click **Upgrade**.
5. In the pop-up window that opens, select a pricing plan. If you are purchasing an Enterprise plan, discuss with the sales team about plan details before proceeding.
6. Complete KYC verification. This is required only if you are purchasing an Enterprise plan for Custodial Wallets or MPC Wallets. Follow the instructions on the screen to submit your KYC application. The time it takes to approve your KYC application can vary based on different factors, including your business and regional compliance policies. **Note**: If you have successfully completed KYC verification during a previous purchase, you will not be asked to submit the application for subsequent purchases.
