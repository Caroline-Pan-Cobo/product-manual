Passkeys provide an additional layer of security, effectively protecting against a range of threats, notably phishing attacks. Moreover, passkeys serve as a login option that allows you to skip multi-factor authentication (MFA) verification if it is enabled. This convenience stems from the fact that MFA verification aims to confirm your ownership of the specific device, aligning with the authentication purpose of passkeys.

1. Log in to [Cobo Accounts](https://accounts.cobo.com/) and click **Login Methods** in the main menu on the left-hand side.
2. Click **Create Passkey** next to **Passkeys**.
