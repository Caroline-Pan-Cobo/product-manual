## Unified login and registration system
Use a single set of login credentials to access most Cobo products in [Cobo Portal](/en/portal/introduction). Enjoy a hassle-free signup and login experience, without the complexities of managing multiple accounts.

## Flexible registration and login methods
Choose from five convenient registration and login methods: email address, Google Account, Web3 wallet, [Cobo Guard](/en/guard/introduction) (login only), and passkey (login only). Looking ahead, Cobo Accounts will integrate additional login and registration methods that tailor to your preferences.

## Diverse multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods
Currently, three MFA methods are supported: Google Authenticator, security key, and [Cobo Guard](/en/guard/introduction). Your MFA methods will be applied across most Cobo products by default, ensuring a consistent identity verification process and eliminating the need for repeated configurations.

## All-in-one account dashboard
View, add/remove, and modify your login and MFA methods easily through the Cobo Accounts dashboard. Gain a comprehensive overview of the services you use and the data stored in your Cobo Accounts.
