title: Generate and back up your key shares
---
To demonstrate how Cobo Guard functions as a key share manager, this section guides you through the key share generation and backup processes from the perspective of a key holder operating on a Cobo Guard app.

The key share generation process is initiated on the Cobo Portal by an admin. The participants selected by the admin as key share holders will receive a notification on their Cobo Guard apps to become key share holders. Once all selected participants have confirmed to become key share holders, key shares are generated on their respective Cobo Guard apps. After the key shares have been generated, key share holders can back up their key shares to iCloud using Cobo Guard.

## Initiate the key generation process
The key share generation process is initiated by the admins on the Cobo Portal. The key shares are categorized into one of the three groups: Main Group, Signing Group, and Recovery Group. We will use the Main Group to illustrate the process.

On the Cobo Portal, admins create a Main Group by navigating to **MPC Wallets** > **[their-vault-name]** > **Create Main Group**.

During the Main Group creation process, the admins select participants to become key share holders. **Note**: Selected participants' Cobo Guard must already be linked to the adminâ€™s organization for them to be eligible for selection as a key share holder on this screen.

Once the Main Group creation is initiated by the admins, selected participants will be notified on Cobo Guard to confirm whether they want to become key share holders.

As a selected participant, you will receive a notification on Cobo Guard to confirm whether you want to become a key share holder. Simply tap the request to open the **Details** page.

On the **Details** page, tap **Approve** to confirm your willingness to become a key share holder. You will need to authenticate yourself with Face ID.

When you see the **Approved** message, you have successfully become a key share holder. You can view the status of this operation by tapping **All** on the main screen of your Cobo Guard app.

## Generate key shares using Cobo Guard
Tap the request to enter the Generate Private Key Shares screen, then tap **Start** to authenticate yourself through Face ID. Keep in mind that the key generation process will start automatically when all participants are online.

When you see the green Private Key Shares Generated message, tap **OK** to return to My Accounts and review the details of your newly generated key share.

## Back up your key shares
Return to the home screen of Cobo Guard. Access My Accounts by tapping the menu icon, then tap **My Accounts**.

Enter the Back Up Your Private Key Shares screen by tapping the cloud icon on the upper right.

**Note**: If you have recently generated key shares, you can also tap **Back Up Now** instead.

On the Back Up Your Private Key Shares screen, tap **Start**, then authenticate yourself using Face ID.

On the Set Recovery Passphrase screen, set a recovery passphrase that will grant access to your backups when restoring key shares from iCloud, then tap **Continue**.

On the **Backup Successful** dialog, tap OK to complete the backup process.
