title: Generate and back up your key shares
---

To demonstrate how Cobo Guard functions as a key share manager, this section guides you through the key share generation and backup processes from the perspective of a key share holder operating on a Cobo Guard app.

The key share generation process is initiated on the Cobo Portal by an admin. The members selected by the admin as key share holders will receive a notification on their Cobo Guard apps to become key share holders. All selected members must confirm to become key share holders before the key generation process can start. After the key shares have been generated, key share holders can back up their key shares to iCloud using Cobo Guard.

## Initiate the key generation process
The key share generation process is initiated by the admins on the Cobo Portal. The key shares are categorized into one of the three groups: Main Group, Signing Group, and Recovery Group. We will use the Main Group to illustrate the process.

On the Cobo Portal, admins create a Main Group by navigating to **MPC Wallets** > **[vault-name]** > **Create Main Group**.

During the Main Group creation process, the admins select members to become key share holders. **Note**: Selected members' Cobo Guard must already be linked to the adminâ€™s organization for them to be eligible for selection as a key share holder.

Once the Main Group creation is initiated by the admins, selected members will be notified on their Cobo Guard to confirm whether they want to become key share holders.

Simply tap the request to open the **Details** page.

On the **Details** page, tap **Approve** to confirm your willingness to become a key share holder. You will need to authenticate yourself with Face ID.

When you see the **Approved** message, you have successfully become a key share holder. You can view the status of this operation by tapping **All** on the main screen of your Cobo Guard app.

## Generate key shares using Cobo Guard
Tap the request to enter the **Generate Private Key Shares** screen, then tap **Start** to authenticate yourself through Face ID. Keep in mind that the key generation process will start automatically when all selected members are online.

When you see the green **Private Key Shares Generated** message, tap **OK** to return to My Accounts and review the details of your newly generated key share.

## Back up your key shares
Return to the home screen of Cobo Guard. Access My Accounts by tapping <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_menu.svg" className="icon"></img> and then <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_account.svg" className="icon"></img> **My Accounts**.

Enter the **Back Up Your Private Key Shares** screen by tapping <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_cloud.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right.

**Note**: If you have recently generated key shares, you can also tap **Back Up Now** instead.

On the **Back Up Your Private Key Shares** screen, tap **Start**, then authenticate yourself using Face ID.
