## Why did we design Cobo Guard?
### Asymmetric encryption for asset safety
Cobo Guard utilizes asymmetric encryption to ensure the safety of your assets. Your public key is shared with Cobo, while your private key is securely stored in your iPhoneâ€™s native Secure Enclave. This ensures that all operation approvals are signed by your private key and authenticated through the public key by Cobo.

<Note>We take security very seriously. To maintain our rigorous security standards, Cobo Guard is currently available exclusively for iOS devices, which provide the level of security required for our institutional-grade digital asset protection.</Note>
