## What is Cobo Guard
<Note>Currently, Cobo Guard only supports the iOS system. The app is compatible with iPhone 6s and newer models, and the operating system must be iOS 13.0 or later.</Note>

Cobo Guard is a multifunctional security iOS application designed to elevate the safety and protection of your digital assets on the go. It functions as a MPC key share manager and a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method for approvals on operations including login and transactions.

## Why did we design Cobo Guard?
### Asymmetric encryption for asset safety
Cobo Guard utilizes asymmetric encryption to ensure the safety of your assets. Your public key is shared with Cobo, while your private key is securely stored in your iPhoneâ€™s native Secure Enclave. This ensures that all operation approvals are signed by your private key and authenticated through the public key by Cobo.

**Note**: We take security very seriously. After thorough evaluation, we have determined that we are unable to offer an Android version of Cobo Guard that meets with our rigorous security standards.
