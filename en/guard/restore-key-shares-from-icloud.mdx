### Create new key shares

If you don't need to restore key shares, choose **No Need to Restore Key Shares**.
    <Warning>If you choose **No Need to Restore Key Shares**, you will not be able to restore to your private key shares afterwards.</Warning>
    On the home screen, you can view the **Link Cobo Guard to your account** message.

## 3. Link to Cobo accounts

1. Log in to [Cobo Accounts](https://accounts.cobo.com/) using an alternative multi-factor authentication (MFA) method, such as Google Authenticator.
    <Note>If you have not set up any other MFA methods and cannot log in to your Cobo Account, please contact our [support team](mailto:help@cobo.com).</Note>

3. Review the important information regarding the reset, then click **Confirm** to display a QR code.
4. Open Cobo Guard on your new device and scan the QR code.
5. On Cobo Guard, choose **Link**.
    With your account successfully linked, the [Cobo Accounts](https://accounts.cobo.com/) page will display a message "Please open Cobo Guard on your old mobile device for authentication".

    - If you can access your old device, open Cobo Guard and choose **Approve**.
    - Otherwise, click **Cobo Guard not available?** on the page, and enter the verification code on Google Authenticator.

You will be redirected to the **MFA Management** tab. On Cobo Guard, tap <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_menu.svg" className="icon"></img> and then **My Accounts**, you will see the email of your Cobo Account. That means your Cobo Guard has been successfully reset.

After the reset, your Cobo Account will be temporarily frozen. An Admin from your organization will need to unfreeze it. If you are the only member of your organization, the whole organization will be frozen for 24 hours. You can log in to the Cobo Portal after this period.
