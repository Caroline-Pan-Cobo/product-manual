title: Restore your key shares from iCloud
---
To demonstrate how Cobo Guard functions as a key share manager, this section guides you through the key share restoration process from the perspective of a key holder operating on a Cobo Guard app.

When you open the Cobo Guard app for the first time, you will be prompted to choose between **Restore Key Shares** or **No Need to Restore Key Shares**.

• Choose **Restore Key Shares** if you have key shares in your old Cobo Guard and need to restore them to your current app.

• Choose **No Need to Restore Key Shares** if you are a new user of Cobo Guard and do not have key shares for restoration, or if you do not require them. You may skip this section if you intend to choose this option.

**Note**: If you have key shares to restore, please select **Restore Key Shares** on this page now. Skipping this step will result in the failure to restore your key shares.

After choosing to **Restore MPC Key Shares**, Cobo Guard will begin to check your key share files.

Select the TSS Node IDs associated with the key shares you want to restore, then tap **Restore**.

Enter the recovery passphrase you set earlier when creating these backups for your key shares, then tap **Confirm**.

Cobo Guard will now verify and restore your key shares.

The restoration process is successful when you see the **Key shares successfully restored** dialog.

Your restored key shares can now be viewed on the Cobo Guard home screen. Tap the menu icon, then tap **My Accounts** to view the restored key shares.
