<Note>Prerequisite: Please assign the [Operator](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role to the designated team members who will set up transaction policies.</Note>

You can effortlessly set up and edit both off-chain and on-chain transaction policies. Note that on-chain transaction policies are governed by smart contracts on the blockchain networks, whereas off-chain transaction policies are managed by the backend system of Cobo Portal.

You can also automate how each transaction will be handled by setting up an approval action. This could include auto approval, auto rejection, and approval quorum.

Each organization manages a list of off-chain and/or on-chain transaction policies. When a transaction is initiated, it undergoes a matching process against the ordered policies in the list. If a matching policy is identified, the corresponding approval action will be automatically executed.
