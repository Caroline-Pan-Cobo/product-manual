## Understanding transaction policies

Each organization manages a list of off-chain and/or on-chain transaction policies. When a transaction is initiated, it undergoes a matching process against the ordered policies in the list. If a matching policy is identified, the corresponding approval action will be automatically executed.

Transaction policies in Cobo Portal come in two main types: 
- On-chain transaction policies
- Off-chain transaction policies

### On-chain transaction policies

On-chain transaction policies are governed by smart contracts on the blockchain networks and are specifically designed for Smart Contract Wallets. These policies provide:
- Delegate management for single-signature operations
- Token approval controls
- Token transfer controls
- Custom contract call controls

Once created, modifications to on-chain transaction policies require multi-signature confirmation from Safe{Wallet} signers.

### Off-chain transaction policies

Off-chain transaction policies are managed by Cobo Portal's backend system. They offer:
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify and update as needed
- **Compatibility**: Works with multiple wallet types
- **Immediate effect**: Changes take effect instantly without blockchain transactions

Off-chain transaction policies include the following types:

| Policy Type | Main Purpose | Key Controls |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Token transfer | Control token movements and limits | • Initiators<br/>• Amounts<br/>• Receiving addresses<br/>• Token types |
| Contract call | Manage smart contract interactions | • Initiators<br/>• Token approvals<br/>• Token transfers<br/>• Contract addresses, methods, and parameters |
| Message signing | Control transaction signing | • Initiators<br/>• Message types<br/>• Safe{Wallet} message signing controls |
| Emergency policy | Immediate risk control for contingency | Enforcing auto rejection or auto quorum for all transactions |

### Smart Contract Wallet policy guide

Smart Contract Wallets can use both on-chain and off-chain transaction policies. Here's when to use each:

**Use on-chain transaction policies when:**
- Setting up delegate permissions that need to be enforced at the smart contract level
- Implementing permanent or long-term rules that shouldn't be easily changed
- Configuring rules that must be executed on-chain for security
- Changes require multi-signature approval from Safe{Wallet} signers

**Use off-chain transaction policies when:**
- Need quick policy updates without requiring multi-sig approval
- Want additional control layers beyond on-chain rules
- Managing temporary or frequently changing rules
- Controlling specific transaction initiators or API access

For maximum security, you can combine both:
1. Use on-chain transaction policies for core security rules
2. Add off-chain transaction policies for flexible, day-to-day control

## Setting up transaction policies

<Note>Prerequisite: Please assign the [Operator](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role to the designated team members who will set up transaction policies.</Note>

<Note>Transaction policies are an important security measure for your organization. It is recommended to strictly configure these policies, especially for large withdrawal scenarios, to avoid high-risk situations such as having no transaction policies, having transactions that are not covered by a transaction policy, automatically approving all transactions, or allowing the same role to both withdraw and approve transactions.</Note>
