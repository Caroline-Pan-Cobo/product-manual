You can manage an on-chain transaction policy by navigating to **Smart Contract Wallets** > **On-Chain Transaction Policies**. The **Current** tab displays all active on-chain transaction policies, the **Queue** tab shows on-chain transaction policies awaiting batch submission for multi-sig confirmations by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers, and the **History** tab lists all submitted multi-sig transaction requests.

- Edit <img src="/en/images/risk-controls/edit.svg" className="icon"></img>: Modify policy details, such as the Delegates and the if-then conditions. Please note that once an on-chain transaction policy is submitted, any modifications will require you to submit a multi-signature request.
- Delete <img src="/en/images/risk-controls/delete.svg" className="icon"></img>: Remove an on-chain transaction policy that is currently in use. Please note that deletion requires you to submit a multi-signature request.
