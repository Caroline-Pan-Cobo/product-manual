## What are risk controls?

Cobo Portal offers a variety of risk control mechanisms designed to address the challenges in storing, managing, and transferring digital assets. You can easily set up both on-chain and off-chain transaction policies, governance policies, as well as user roles and permissions to safeguard your expanding business. Once these risk control measures are configured, no operation can proceed without the required approvals.

1. [Transaction policies](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview): You can effortlessly create and edit both on-chain and off-chain transaction policies, and automate how each transaction will be handled by setting up an approval action, including auto approval, auto rejection, approval quorum, and customized workflows. You can also set up an [emergency policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/manage-emergency-policy) when risks are detected, enforcing auto rejection or auto quorum for all transactions across your organization.

2. [Governance policies](/en/portal/organization/governance-intro): You can define the number of organization admins required to review certain operations, such as deleting a team member or freezing an organization.

3. [User roles and permissions](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions): You can assign specific roles to designated team members. Cobo Portal offers preset user roles, such as Admin, Approver, Spender, Staker, Operator, and Viewer, while also providing the flexibility to create additional roles that are custom-made to meet your specific needs.
