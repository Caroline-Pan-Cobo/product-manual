<Note>Prerequisite: Please assign the [admin](/en/portal/organization/assign-roles-to-members) role to the designated team members who will set up governance policies.</Note>

You can set up governance policies to define the number of team members needed to approve certain operations (e.g., delete a team member, modify member roles, freeze the organization). Depending on the operation, the default rule mandates approvals from at least 50% of the admins or approval by one of the admins. You can also manually edit the rule to be auto approval, auto rejection, approval quorum, or customized workflow. To learn more about governance policies, see [Introduction to governance policies](/en/portal/organization/governance-intro).
