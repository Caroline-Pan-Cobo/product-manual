<Note>Transaction policies are an important security measure for your organization. It is recommended to strictly configure these policies to avoid high-risk situations such as having no transaction policies, having transactions that are not covered by a transaction policy, automatically approving all transactions, or allowing the same role to both withdraw and approve transactions.</Note>

General policies apply to all types of transactions.

## Create a general policy
1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"/> > **Transaction Policies** in the main menu on the left-hand side.
3. Click **Create Policy** > **General Policy**.

4. Enter a **Policy Name**. The name should not exceed 50 characters.
5. Select all the wallets under **Applicable Wallets** that are applicable to the policy you are about to create. The following wallet types support token transfer policies:
   - Custodial Wallets
     - Asset Wallets
     - Web3 Wallets
   - MPC Wallets
     - Organization-Controlled Wallets
     - User-Controlled Wallets
   - Smart Contract Wallets
   - Exchange Wallets
6. Under **If**, the condition is fixed: **Any Transaction**. Under **Then**, select the action to be taken when a transaction matches the policy:
   - **Auto Approval**: Automatically approve the transaction without requiring manual review.
   - **Auto Rejection**: Automatically reject the transaction.
   - **Approval Quorum**: Require a specified number of approvals to proceed. Click **+ Select Approvers** to add one or more team members as approvers. You can select by **User Roles** or **Users**. Then, set the approval quorum.

7. Click **Next**. Review the policy details. If everything is correct, click **Confirm** to create the policy.
8. Review the policy you just configured, then click **Next**.
9. Review the order of your policies. Transactions will be matched with policies in the list based on their priority order.
      - Once a higher-priority policy is triggered, subsequent policies will no longer be triggered.
      - By default, the newly created policy will be placed at the top of the policy list and highlighted. You can change the order by dragging and dropping.
10. Click **Submit** and complete the 2FA verification.
