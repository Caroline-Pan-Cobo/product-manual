<Note>Transaction policies are an important security measure for your organization. It is recommended to strictly configure these policies, especially for large withdrawal scenarios, to avoid high-risk situations such as having no transaction policies, having no rules matched, automatically approving all transactions, or allowing the same role to both withdraw and approve transactions.</Note>

<Note>The following documentation explains how to set up message signing policies with the **Initiators** or **Message Types** conditions. For Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; message signing policies, see [Risk controls for Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; message signing](/en/portal/risk-controls/safe-risk-controls).</Note>

## Create a message signing policy
1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"/> > **Transaction Policies** in the main menu on the left-hand side.
3. Click **Create Policy** > **Sign Message**.

4. Enter a **Policy Name**. The name should not exceed 30 characters.
5. Select applicable networks. 
6. Select the wallets under **Applicable Wallets** that are applicable to the policy you are about to create. Select addresses.
7. Under **If**, click **+ Add Condition** to select a condition template. You can add one or more conditions to each policy. If multiple conditions are applied, the policy will be triggered only if the transaction satisfies all conditions. To learn more about conditions, see [Select condition template](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-message-signing#select-condition-template).
   - You have the option to skip setting any conditions and proceed directly to the next step. This means that any message signing requests associated with the applicable wallets will trigger this policy.
8. Under **Then**, Select the action to be taken if the policy is triggered (i.e., **Auto Approval**, **Auto Rejection**, and **Approval Quorum**), then click **Next**. To learn more about approval actions, see [Set approval action](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-message-signing#set-approval-action).
9. Review the policy you just configured, then click **Next**.
10. Review the order of your policies. Transactions will be matched with policies in the list based on their priority order.
      - Once a higher-priority policy is triggered, subsequent policies will no longer be triggered.
      - By default, the newly created policy will be placed at the top of the policy list and highlighted. You can change the order by dragging and dropping.
11. Click **Submit** and complete the 2FA verification.

**Initiators**: The policy will be triggered only if the transaction is initiated by selected entities.

## Set approval action <a id="set-approval-action"></a>
Currently, Cobo Portal supports three types of approval actions:
- **Auto Approval**: Transactions meeting the above conditions will be automatically approved.
- **Auto Rejection**: Transactions meeting the above conditions will be automatically rejected.
- **Approval Quorum**: Transactions meeting the above conditions will require a specified number of approvals to proceed. Please click **+ Select Approvers** to add one or more team members as approvers. You can select by **User Roles** or **Users**. Then, set the approval quorum.
