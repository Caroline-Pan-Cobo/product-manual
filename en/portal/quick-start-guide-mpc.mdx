This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up and using MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) on Cobo Portal. You'll learn how to:

1. Set up your account and organization
2. Create vaults and wallets
3. Make deposits and withdrawals

## Set up an MPC vault

After setting up your account and organization, the next step is to configure an MPC vault. A vault is a collection of wallets sharing the same root extended private key. 

A default vault is automatically created for you. You need to complete the setup by creating a Main Group and generating key shares.

### Create a Main Group

A set of key share holders is referred to as a [holder group](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-overview). The Main Group is the first holder group you create before using MPC Wallets.

The diagram below illustrates a Main Group with two key share holders. Cobo holds one key share, while your organization holds the other.
<img src="/en/images/get-started/key-shares.svg" className="diagram" alt="Key Shares"/>

Follow the instructions below to create a Main Group in Cobo Portal:
1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
      * For testing purposes, use the [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
      * For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Click **Create Main Group**.
4. In the **Create Main Group** dialog box, navigate to the **Key Share Holder 2** section, and configure the holder:

    - To use a mobile co-signer, select a holder from the pull-down list. The **TSS Node ID** field will be filled in automatically. Click **Confirm**.

    - To use a server co-signer, enter a holder name, fill in the TSS Node ID, and then click **Confirm**.

    For high-frequency transactions, we recommend using a server co-signer for automated signing. To learn more about mobile co-signers and server co-signers, see [Co-Signer Type](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group#signer-type).

5. Confirm in your Cobo Guard app that you initiated this request.

### Generate key shares

To finalize the vault setup, the next crucial step is generating key shares on your co-signer. This process varies depending on your co-signer type:

* For mobile co-signers, tap the pop-up banner on Cobo Guard and follow the instructions on the screen to generate key shares.

* For server co-signers:
  * Ensure the TSS Node server is brought online within 24 hours. The key share generation process initiates automatically when the server comes online.
  * If a [TSS Node callback server](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/callback-server-overview) is configured, the generation process will only start after approval from the callback server.

Once the key generation process is completed, the holder group status will become **Active** on Cobo Portal. You might need to refresh the Cobo Portal page to see the updated result.


## Integrate using the WaaS API

Once you've set up the vault, you can start creating wallets and transfer tokens. This can be done directly through Cobo Portal's user interface or programmatically using the WaaS API.

This guide introduces wallet creation and token transfer through Cobo Portal. For programmatic access via the WaaS API, refer to our [Developer Hub](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/) and follow these steps:

1. Start with [Sending your first request](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/get-started/get-started-with-waas). This guide covers API key registration, authentication, and SDK usage.
2. Proceed to [Integrate MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled)](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ocw) for detailed instructions on creating wallets and managing token transactions.


## Create a wallet

After successful key generation, a default wallet is automatically created for your vault. You can create additional wallets by following the steps below:

1. Navigate back to the vault's main page.
2. Click **Create Wallet**. In the dialog box:
   - Enter a unique name for your wallet.
   - If you need to automatically consolidate funds from multiple addresses, enable [Auto-Sweep](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/auto-sweep-overview). If you're unsure, you can leave it disabled for now and enable it later if needed.
3. Click **Create**.
4. From the wallet list, select your newly created wallet to view its details.
5. Explore the token and address lists. The wallet comes with some pre-added tokens. To add more, click **Add Tokens**.


## Make a deposit

To make a deposit, you should first generate a deposit address for your wallet:

1. Navigate to the **Addresses** tab, and then click **Add Address**.
2. Select a network, and then click **Create**.
3. Navigate to the address you just created and click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/icon_deposit.svg" className="icon"></img> to display the address.
<img src="/en/images/get-started/deposit.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Add Tokens"/>
4. Proceed to your preferred external wallet to initiate the transfer to the deposit address.

## Make a withdrawal

Follow the steps below to withdraw tokens from your wallet. To learn more about withdrawal, such as transaction fees, risk control measures, and signing procedures, see [Transfer from MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets)](/en/portal/transfers/from-mpc-wallets).

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login) and then click <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button.svg" className="icon"></img> in the main menu on the left hand side.
<img src="/en/images/get-started/withdraw.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>
2. In the **Transfer** dialog box, fill in the required information, and then click **Submit**.
3. Double confirm the withdrawal on Cobo Guard.
4. A co-signer will be selected to sign the transaction based on their online status and other criteria. Ensure at least one co-signer is online.

After you sign the transaction, Cobo creates and broadcasts it to the network. The token transfer may take some time to complete, depending on network conditions.

## Whatâ€™s next

Congratulations on successfully setting up your MPC Wallet (Organization-Controlled Wallet) and completing token transfers! To enhance the security of your assets, consider taking these crucial next steps:

* Configuring transaction policies, which help prevent unauthorized transactions and provide additional control. For detailed instructions, refer to [Setting up token transfer policies](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer).

* Back up your key shares to prevent loss or compromise. For instructions on how to back up key shares, see [Back up key shares](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/back-up-key-share-groups).

* Create Signing Groups and Recovery Groups. To learn what each holder group does and how to create them, see [Holder group overview](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-overview).
