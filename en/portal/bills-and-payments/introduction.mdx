Cobo offers various pricing plans tailored to your special business requirements. You can find a detailed introduction of each plan on the [pricing page](https://www.cobo.com/pricing). Each plan includes predefined usage quotas, such as the number of addresses you can generate, the number of chains you can use, and the total volume of assets you can store under Cobo’s services, among others.

- **Starter plan and Standard plan**: These plans are designed for small and growing businesses with relatively low usage requirements.
- **Enterprise plan**: The Enterprise plan is designed for businesses that require higher usage and custom implementations.

## Usage items

The following list provides an overview of the usage items included in the pricing plans. Please note that the specific usage items may vary depending on the plan you select.

- **Outgoing Transfer Volume**: The total volume of assets you have withdrawn to external addresses. Transfers within and between Custodial Wallets, MPC Wallets, and Smart Contract Wallets are not counted as outgoing transfers.
- **Asset Under Custody**: The total volume of assets you store within Cobo Portal.
- **Wallet Addresses**: The number of addresses you have generated.
- **Supported Chains**: The number of chains you have enabled. Once a chain is enabled, it is considered in use and will count toward your plan inclusion.
- **API Calls**: The number of WaaS API requests you have sent. This is calculated for the entire organization.
- **Users**: The number of users in your organization. This is calculated for the entire organization.

Once your free trial expires or when you hit the usage limits of the free trial, you will only be able to view your MPC Wallets and Exchange Wallets. All other features and capabilities will be available to you once you have purchased our paid plans. 

For paid plans, once you reach your usage limits, you will need to pay overage charges for any usage exceeding the limits at the corresponding unit price. In such cases, you have the option to purchase add-on packages at a discounted rate or upgrade to a higher-tier plan.
