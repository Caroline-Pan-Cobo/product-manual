It is recommended that you purchase add-on packages or upgrade to a higher-tier plan when one or more usages are nearing their limits. This will ensure uninterrupted service and avoid any potential disruptions or overage charges.

**Notes:**

- You can purchase multiple add-on packages of the same type. The deduction rules are as follows:	
  - The usage that expires first is deducted first. If the expiration dates are the same, the deduction is based on the time of order placement, with the earlier order being deducted first.
  - After all add-on packages have been deducted, any remaining excess usage will be subject to overage charges calculated at the corresponding unit price.
- Add-on packages cannot be used for deductions beyond the expiration date. To avoid increased costs or business impact, it is recommended that you promptly purchase additional add-on packages when the current ones are running out.
