You must purchase a pricing plan before you can start using a wallet. Specifically for [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) and [Smart Contract Wallets](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/introduction), a 14-day free trial period will soon be available. Once your free trial expires or you reach the usage limits of the free trial, you will need to purchase a pricing plan.

## Prerequisites
- If you're interested in our Enterprise plan, [reach out to our sales team](https://www.cobo.com/book-demo/?utm_source=product-manual&utm_medium=product&utm_campaign=pricing-plan-intro&utm_content=enterprise-contact-sales) who will assist you in finding a custom plan that best suits your needs.
- Note that when you purchase an Enterprise plan for [Custodial Wallets](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/introduction) or [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction), you will be required to go through Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. The following are a few examples of documents and information you may be asked to provide during the process.
   - Your company information, such as company name and registered address.
   - Company documents, such as certified copies of the company's certificate of incorporation and articles of association.
   - Shareholder or Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) information.
