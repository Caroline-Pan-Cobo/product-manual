Every pricing plan has its billing cycle starting from the day of purchase, and a bill is generated at the end of the billing cycle.

Your total amount payable is composed of three parts:

- The costs of pricing plans you have purchased.
- The costs of add-on packages you have purchased.
- Overage charges for any usage not covered by the pricing plans and add-on packages.

It is important to settle your bill within 14 days from the date it is generated. Failure to do so may result in the suspension of your service. If you have set up automatic renewal for a pricing plan, the corresponding bill will be settled automatically.
