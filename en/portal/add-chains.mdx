Cobo supports more than 80 mainstream public chains, and most of them are enabled by default to meet the needs of most users. Due to the billing and resource control, not all supported chains are enabled by default. If a supported chain is missing during transactions or wallet operations, you can add it to your organization by following the steps below.

<Note><ul><li>Once a chain is added to your wallet, you will be able to use the tokens on the chain.</li><li>Once a chain is added, it is considered in use and will count towards your plan inclusion. Overage charges will be applicable for usage exceeding the plan inclusion.</li></ul></Note>

## Prerequisites
