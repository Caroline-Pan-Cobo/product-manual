## Prerequisite

- It's recommended that you set up an [off-chain transaction policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer).
- You have [deposited](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/transfers) funds into the Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets).

## Steps

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login) and then click <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button.svg" className="icon" alt="The transfer button" /> in the main menu.
    <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button-location.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>

2. Then, select the token type for the transfer. Selection is limited to tokens included in your organization's subscription package. To enable a new token type (fees apply), see step 1 to 6 on [Deposit from external wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/transfers#deposit-from-external-wallets).
3. In the drop-down menu under "From", select **Asset Wallets** under **Custodial Wallets**.
    To find your wallet, select it from the drop-down menu or search by the wallet name. Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets) created via both Cobo Portal and WaaS 2.0 API will be listed.
4. Select a "To" address from your Address Book or a Cobo wallet, or manually input an external address.
    <img src="/en/images/transfers/to-address.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>
    - **Address Book**: Only addresses associated with the blockchain network of the selected token will be listed.
    - **My Wallet**: Select a wallet type and then click on the specific wallet you would like to transfer to.
    - **Other Addresses**: Manually enter an external address as the destination address under "To". If it is a new address not found in your Address Book or any of your wallets created on Cobo Portal, you will be prompted to add the address to your Address Book.
    <br />
    If this transfer can be executed as a [Cobo Loop](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/cobo-loop) transfer, a related information bar will appear on the UI as the following screenshot shows. You can toggle the button to enforce the transaction as a Cobo Loop transfer, or otherwise.
    <img src="/en/images/transfers/loop_info_bar.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Screenshot of the information bar" />
    <Info>If you are using the WaaS 2.0 API, you can use the [Check Cobo Loop transfers](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/check-loop-transfers) operation to determine if a transaction can be executed as a Cobo Loop transfer. Or directly call the [Transfer token](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/transfer-token) operation to enforce a transaction as a Cobo Loop transfer.</Info>
5. Enter the transfer amount.
6. Review the transaction cost. Transaction cost includes network fees. You are unable to modify or customize this fee. The associated fees will be deducted from the selected  "From" address, and it may differ from the token intended for the transfer.
7. <MySnippet />
8. Click **Submit**.
9. Approve the request on your Cobo Guard. If it is a new address not found in your Address Book or any of your wallets created on Cobo Portal, you will be prompted to add the address to your Address Book.

## Next-Steps

After making a transfer from your Custodial Wallets, you can view its transaction status in **Transaction History**. The flash icon <img src="/en/images/custodial-wallet/icon_loop.png" className="icon" alt="The flash icon" /> indicates it was executed as a Cobo Loop transfer as the following screenshot shows.
<img src="/en/images/transfers/loop_history.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Screenshot of the transaction history" />

If you are using the WaaS 2.0 API, you can call the [Get transaction information](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/get-transaction-information) or [List all transactions operations](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/list-all-transactions) and check the `is_loop` property in the response. 
Additionally, you can use the [Cobo Loop Explorer](https://loop.top/) along with the Loop ID (the transaction hash of the transfer) to track the status of Cobo Loop transfers.
