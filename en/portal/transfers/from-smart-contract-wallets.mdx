<Info>Due to the Bybit security incident, Safe Wallet has suspended third-party delegate call services. As a result, Cobo's Smart Contract Wallets and related services (including on-chain transaction policies) are temporarily unavailable. However, existing wallets and on-chain transaction policies can still be used. Recovery timeline will be announced later.</Info>

<Note>Prerequisite: Before making a transfer from Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;), please make sure that you have [created](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/create) a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; in Cobo Portal or [imported](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/import) Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; instances from Cobo Argus, set up an on-chain transfer policy (required), set up an [off-chain transaction policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer) (recommended), and successfully [deposited](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/deposit-assets) funds into the Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;).</Note>

<img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button-location.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>

Then, fill in the required information as follows:

1. For **Wallet Type**, select **Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;** under **Smart Contract Wallets**. For the wallet address, select from the drop-down menu or search by wallet name, address, or label. Asset Wallets created via both Cobo Portal and WaaS 2.0 API will be listed.
2. Select the token type and network for the transfer. Selection is limited to tokens included in your organization's subscription package. To enable a new token type (fees apply), see step 1 to 6 on [Deposit from external wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/transfers#deposit-from-external-wallets).
3. Select a recipient address from your Address Book or your wallets on Cobo Portal, or manually enter an address.
    - **Address Book**<img src="/en/images/common/icon_address_book.svg" className="icon" alt="Address Book icon" />: Only addresses associated with the blockchain network of the selected token will be listed.
    - **My Wallets**: Select a wallet type and then click on the specific wallet you would like to transfer to.
4. Enter the transfer amount.
5. Select a Delegate address (abbreviated as Delegate). For more information on Delegates, see [Set up on-chain transaction policies for token transfers](/en/portal/risk-controls/on-chain-tx-type).
    - If you have not added any Delegates to the Smart Contract Wallet (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;) yet, please add a Delegate first.
    - If the selected Delegate lacks gas tokens, please follow the on-screen instructions to top up gas fees for the Delegate first.

6. Review the transaction cost. Network fees will be displayed in 3 tiers based on transaction speeds: slow, standard, and fast.
7. To customize the fee, click **Customize**.
8. The fields will be auto populated based on the transaction speed you have selected. You may customize the gas price and gas limit based on your specific requirements.
    - The fee will be covered by the Delegate.
    - The estimated fee is calculated by multiplying the max fee by the gas limit: (max fee * gas limit). See [provided table under EIP 1559](/en/portal/transfers/from-mpc-wallets#eip1559) for definition of the parameters.
    - If the Delegate lacks sufficient gas tokens, click **Top up to Delegate** to deposit the required gas tokens.
9. <MySnippet />
10. Click **Submit**.
11. Approve the request on your Cobo Guard. If it is a new address not found in your Address Book or any of your wallets created on Cobo Portal, you will be prompted to add the address to your Address Book.
