Then, fill in the required information as follows:

1. Select the token type for the transfer. Selection is limited to tokens included in your organization's subscription package. To enable a new token type (fees apply), see step 1 to 6 on [Deposit from external wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/transfers#deposit-from-external-wallets).
2. In the drop-down menu under **From**, select **Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;** under **Smart Contract Wallets**.
3. To find your wallet, select it from the drop-down menu or search by the address, Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; name or label. Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;) created via both Cobo Portal and WaaS 2.0 API will be listed.
4. Select a Delegate address (abbreviated as Delegate). For more information on Delegates, see [Set up on-chain transaction policies for token transfers](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/set-up-delegates).
    - If you have not added any Delegates to the Smart Contract Wallet (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;) yet, please add a Delegate first.
    - If the selected Delegate lacks gas tokens, please follow the on-screen instructions to top up gas fees for the Delegate first.

5. Select a **To** address from your Address Book or your wallets on Cobo Portal, or manually enter an address.

    - **My Wallets**: Select a wallet type and then click on the specific wallet you would like to transfer to.
6. Enter the transfer amount.
7. Review the transaction cost. Network fees will be displayed in 3 tiers based on transaction speeds: slow, standard, and fast.
8. To customize the fee, click **Customize**.
9. The fields will be auto populated based on the transaction speed you have selected. You may customize the gas price and gas limit based on your specific requirements.
    - The fee will be covered by the Delegate.
    - The estimated fee is calculated by multiplying the max fee by the gas limit: (max fee * gas limit). See [provided table under EIP 1559](/en/portal/transfers/from-mpc-wallets#eip1559) for definition of the parameters.
    - If the Delegate lacks sufficient gas tokens, click **Top up to Delegate** to deposit the required gas tokens.
