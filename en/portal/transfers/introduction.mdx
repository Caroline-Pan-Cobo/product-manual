Description: "Get an overview of the Transfer module in Cobo Portal, designed to facilitate asset movement across various wallet types seamlessly."

The Transfer module is meticulously designed to streamline the movement of assets within, into, and out of the four wallet types available on Cobo Portal. These encompass Custodial Wallets, MPC Wallets, Smart Contract Wallets, and Exchange Wallets. Currently, Cobo Portal supports the following transfer scenarios:


1. Transfers from Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets), MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets), Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;), or Exchange Wallets to external addresses.
2. Transfers between Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets), MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets), Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;), and Exchange Wallets.
3. Transfers between Main Accounts and Sub Accounts within the same exchange.

To make a transfer, log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login) and then click <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button.svg" className="icon"></img> in the main menu on the left hand side.

    - **Available**: Balance available for transfer in the source wallet address.
- **Transaction Cost**: Fees associated with the transaction, such as network fees.
- **Category (Optional)**: Add up to 5 custom categories to easily identify your transactions.
