This article explains the withdrawal process for MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) and guides you through initiating withdrawals in Cobo Portal.

## Prerequisites

- It's recommended that you set up an [off-chain transaction policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer) to ensure transaction security.
- You have [deposited funds](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/transfers) into the Organization-Controlled Wallet.

## Withdrawal process

The diagram below outlines the withdrawal flow from an Organization-Controlled Wallet via both Cobo Portal and the WaaS API.

<img src="/en/images/transfers/mpc-withdrawal-process.svg" className="diagram" alt="The steps involved in a withdrawal from an Organization-Controlled Wallet"/>

1. **Initiate a withdrawal request**: A spender initiates a withdrawal request via Cobo Portal or [the WaaS API](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ocw#withdraw-tokens).
2. **Double confirmation**:
   - For Cobo Portal initiated withdrawals: Confirm the withdrawal on [Cobo Guard](/en/guard/introduction).
   - For WaaS API initiated withdrawals: Your [callback endpoint](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/introduction) needs to respond with "ok" to confirm.
3. **[Risk control](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview)**: If configured, transaction policies in Cobo Portal assess the withdrawal request. When manual review is required, approvers must approve the transaction on Cobo Guard.
4. **Sign the transaction**: A [co-signer](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group#create-a-main-group) will be selected to sign the transaction based on their online status and other criteria. Ensure that at least one of your co-signers is online. You can check if a co-signer is online through Cobo Portal. For details, see [Check co-signer status](#check-co-signer-status).
5. **Broadcast the transaction**: Cobo creates the transaction and broadcasts it to the network.


## Initiate a withdrawal

To make a transfer from an Organization-Controlled Wallets, log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login) and then click <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button.svg" className="icon"></img> in the main menu on the left hand side.

<img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button-location.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>
 
<Note>On Cobo Portal, tokens can only be transferred to one destination at a time. To transfer tokens to multiple addresses, use the [Transfer token API operation](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/transfer-token).</Note>

Then, fill in the required information as follows:

1. For **Wallet Type**, select **MPC Wallets (Org-Controlled Wallets)**. 
2. For the wallet address, select from the drop-down menu or search by address, vault name, wallet name, or label. MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) created via both Cobo Portal and WaaS 2.0 API will be listed.
3. Select the token type and network for the transfer. Selection is limited to tokens included in your organization's subscription package. To enable a new token type (fees apply), see step 1 to 6 on [Deposit from external wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/transfers#deposit-from-external-wallets).
4. Select a recipient address from your Address Book or your wallets on Cobo Portal, or manually enter an address.
    - **Address Book**<img src="/en/images/common/icon_address_book.svg" className="icon" alt="Address Book icon" />: Only addresses associated with the blockchain network of the selected token will be listed.
    - **My Wallets**: Select a wallet type and then click on the specific wallet you would like to transfer to.
5. Enter the transfer amount. Please note that for DOT, XRP, or KSM tokens, a minimum balance must be maintained in the selected MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets). For DOT, reserve a minimum of 1 DOT; for XRP, 10 XRP; and for KSM, 0.000333333 KSM.

    <Info>The maximum amount you can transfer is affected by transaction fees, available balance, and locked amounts: <ul><li>(Withdrawal amount + transaction fee) \> available balance: The withdrawal request cannot be submitted.</li><li>(Withdrawal amount + transaction fee) ≤ (current balance - locked amount): Your withdrawal request will be processed immediately.</li><li>(current balance - locked amount) \< (withdrawal amount + transaction fee) ≤ available balance: You can successfully submit a withdrawal request, but your transaction will be queued.</li></ul>For more information, please refer to [Balances and transaction amounts for MPC Wallets](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/balance-amounts).</Info>

6. Review the transaction cost. Network fees will be displayed in 3 tiers based on transaction speeds: slow, standard, and fast.
7. To adjust the fees, click the button highlighted below. All fields are mandatory and will be auto-populated based on the transaction speed you have selected. You may edit the parameters based on your specific requirements.

    - EVM  chains: For EVM chains, transaction fees vary between the EIP1559 and Legacy methods.
        - EIP 1559
            - Under the EIP1559 method, users can customize 3 parameters: max priority fee (gwei), max fee, and gas limit.
            - The estimated fee is calculated by multiplying the max fee by the gas limit: (max fee * gas limit).
            - For Mantle and Optimism, the displayed fee amount pertains to Layer 2 only. After you submit the transaction, Layer 1 fees will be auto deducted from your source wallet address. Please ensure that your address has sufficient gas tokens to cover all fees.
            - There are no fees for Chiliz, whereas fees apply to Chiliz Chain 2.0.

## Check co-signer status

To successfully sign a transaction, you need to ensure that at least one of your co-signers is online. The transaction will remain pending until it receives the necessary signature. 

You can check if a co-signer is online through Cobo Portal:
1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/transfers/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click the **Manage Share Management** icon <img src="/en/images/transfers/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
4. In the **Key Group Management** page, locate your key share holder group, and check the status indicator next to each key share holder:
   - 🟢 Green dot: The co-signer is online and ready to sign transactions
   - No dot: The co-signer is offline and cannot sign transactions.
      - For server co-signers, they need to start the TSS Node to stay online.
      - For mobile co-signers, they need to open the Cobo Guard app to stay online.
