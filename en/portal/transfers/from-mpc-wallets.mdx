This article explains the withdrawal process for MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) and guides you through initiating withdrawals in Cobo Portal.

## Prerequisites

- It's recommended that you set up an [off-chain transaction policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer) to ensure transaction security.
- You have [deposited funds](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/transfers) into the Organization-Controlled Wallet.

## Withdrawal process

The diagram below outlines the withdrawal flow from an Organization-Controlled Wallet via both Cobo Portal and the WaaS API.

<img src="/en/images/transfers/mpc-withdrawal-process.svg" className="diagram" alt="The steps involved in a withdrawal from an Organization-Controlled Wallet"/>

1. **Initiate a withdrawal request**: A spender initiates a withdrawal request via Cobo Portal or the WaaS API.
2. **Double confirmation**:
   - For Cobo Portal initiated withdrawals: Confirm the withdrawal on [Cobo Guard](/en/guard/introduction).
   - For WaaS API initiated withdrawals: Your [callback endpoint](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/introduction) needs to respond with "ok" to confirm.
3. **Risk control**: If configured, transaction policies in Cobo Portal assess the withdrawal request. When manual review is required, approvers must approve the transaction on Cobo Guard.
4. **Sign the transaction**: Cobo selects an available [co-signer](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group#create-a-main-group) to sign the transaction based on their online status and other criteria.
   - Mobile co-signer: Signs via Cobo Guard.
   - [Server co-signer](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/tss-node-overview): A TSS Node server signs the transaction with the TSS Node callback server's approval.
5. **Broadcast the transaction**: Cobo creates the transaction and broadcasts it to the network.

Below are steps to initiate a withdrawal in Cobo Portal. For API integration, see [Get started with MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets)](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ocw).

<Note>On Cobo Portal, tokens can only be transferred to one destination at a time. To transfer tokens to multiple addresses, use the [Transfer token API operation](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/transfer-token).</Note>

Then, fill in the required information as follows:

1. Select the token type for the transfer. Selection is limited to tokens included in your organization's subscription package. To enable a new token type (fees apply), see step 1 to 6 on [Deposit from external wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/transfers#deposit-from-external-wallets).
2. In the drop-down menu under **From**, select **Organization-Controlled Wallets** from **MPC Wallets**.
3. To find your wallet, select it from the drop-down menu or search by the address, vault name, wallet name, or label. MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) created via both Cobo Portal and WaaS 2.0 API will be listed.
4. Select a **To** address from your Address Book or your wallets on Cobo Portal, or manually enter an address.
    - **Address Book**<img src="/en/images/common/icon_address_book.svg" className="icon" alt="Address Book icon" />: Only addresses associated with the blockchain network of the selected token will be listed.
    - **My Wallets**: Select a wallet type and then click on the specific wallet you would like to transfer to.
5. Enter the transfer amount. Please note that for DOT, XRP, or KSM tokens, a minimum balance must be maintained in the selected MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets). For DOT, reserve a minimum of 1 DOT; for XRP, 10 XRP; and for KSM, 0.000333333 KSM.
6. Review the transaction cost. Network fees will be displayed in 3 tiers based on transaction speeds: slow, standard, and fast.
7. To adjust the fees, click the button highlighted below. All fields are mandatory and will be auto-populated based on the transaction speed you have selected. You may edit the parameters based on your specific requirements.

    - EVM  chains: For EVM chains, transaction fees vary between the EIP1559 and Legacy methods.
        - EIP 1559
            - Under the EIP1559 method, users can customize 3 parameters: max priority fee (gwei), max fee, and gas limit.
            - The estimated fee is calculated by multiplying the max fee by the gas limit: (max fee * gas limit).
            - For Mantle and Optimism, the displayed fee amount pertains to Layer 2 only. After you submit the transaction, Layer 1 fees will be auto deducted from your source wallet address. Please ensure that your address has sufficient gas tokens to cover all fees.
            - There are no fees for Chiliz, whereas fees apply to Chiliz Chain 2.0.

            - Under the Legacy method, users can customize 2 parameters: gas price (gwei) and gas limit.
            - The estimated fee is calculated by multiplying the gas price by the gas limit: (gas price * gas limit).
