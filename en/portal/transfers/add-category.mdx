When making a transfer, you can add a transaction category and description to identify this transfer more easily.

1. To add a category and/or description to your transaction, click **More** in the **Transfer** dialog box, as highlighted below:

2. Either create a new category or select from existing ones. Each transfer can be associated with a maximum of 5 categories. Note that once a category is added, it cannot be edited or deleted. Currently, Cobo Portal allows the creation of up to 200 categories.
    - To view the categories under your organization, navigate to the main menu on the left hand side and click **Organization Settings** > **Transaction Categories**.
3. Add a description for your transaction, with a maximum limit of 100 characters.
