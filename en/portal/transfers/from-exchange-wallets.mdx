This article explains how to withdraw assets from an Exchange Wallet. In this context, a withdrawal refers to transferring assets from an Exchange Wallet to another wallet created on the Cobo Portal or an external address. 

Only Exchange Wallets (Main Account) with a trading account type of Spot or Fund support withdrawals. To withdraw assets from an Exchange Wallet (Sub Account), you must first transfer the assets from the Sub Account to the associated Main Account, and then withdraw from the Main Account. To learn more about transfers between the Sub Accounts and associated Main Accounts and transfers between trading accounts, see [Transfer Within an Exchange Wallet](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/within-wallet).

For the list of exchanges supported by Cobo Portal, refer to [Supported exchanges](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/supported-exchanges).

## Prerequisites

- You have successfully linked an exchange account to your Exchange Wallet.
- It is highly recommended that you set up an [off-chain transaction policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview) for your Exchange Wallet.
- Your Exchange Wallet has sufficient balance.

## Steps

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).

5. In the **From** section, select the Exchange Wallet from which you want to transfer assets.

    <Note>If the Exchange Wallet you want is not selectable, it means the currently selected asset type is not supported. Please try selecting a different asset type.</Note>
