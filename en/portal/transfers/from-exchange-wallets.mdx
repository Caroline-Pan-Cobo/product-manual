This article describes how to transfer assets from an Exchange Wallet, including transfer ins and outs (transfers within an Exchange Wallet) and withdrawals (transfers to another Cobo wallet or an external address).

For the list of exchanges supported by Cobo Portal, refer to [Supported exchanges](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/supported-exchanges).

## Prerequisites

- You have successfully linked an exchange account to your Exchange Wallet.
- It is highly recommended that you set up an [off-chain transaction policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer) for your Exchange Wallet. 
- Your Exchange Wallet has sufficient balance.

## Steps

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click the transfer icon <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button.svg" className="icon" alt="the transfer icon"></img> in the main menu to display the **Transfer** dialog.
    <Info>You can also initiate a transfer by clicking the withdraw icon <img src="/en/images/exchange-wallet/11.png" className="icon" alt="the withdraw icon"></img> or transfer out icon <img src="/en/images/exchange-wallet/13.png" className="icon" alt="the transfer out icon"></img> on the Exchange Wallet details page. In this case, the <b>From</b> section and <b>Token</b> field will be accordingly prefilled.</Info>

3. In the dialog, select the asset type from the **Token** dropdown list. 
<Note>The available assets for selection depend on the <a href="/en/portal/bills-and-payments/introduction">pricing plan</a> that your <a href="/en/portal/organization/introduction">organization</a> purchases. To enable a new asset, click <b>Not Enabled</b> and follow the instructions.</Note>
4. In the **From** section, select the Exchange Wallet from which you want to transfer assets.
5. In the **To** section, specify the address to which you want to transfer assets in either of the following ways: 
    - If it's a Cobo wallet, click **My Wallets** and select from the dropdown list. 
    - If it's saved in your Address Book, click **Address Book** and select from the dropdown list.
    - Or click **Other Addresses** and manually enter the address in the text field.

    The account that your Exchange Wallet links impacts the types of destinations that you can transfer assets to.

    In most cases, you can transfer from an Exchange Wallet (Main Account) to all kinds of destinations, including its Sub Accounts, other exchange accounts on the same or another exchanges, another Cobo wallet, or an external address. For transfers to another Cobo wallet or an external address, the trading account type of the Main Account must be **Spot**. 

    You can only transfer assets from an Exchange Wallet (Sub Account) to its Main Account or other trading accounts within the same Exchange Wallet.

    <Note>The specific behaviors are subject to the exchange's rules. If you can select the wallet on the UI, then you are able to transfer assets to that wallet.</Note>

7. Enter the transfer amount.
8. Review the transaction cost.
    <Note>For transfers between Main Accounts and Sub Accounts on the same exchange, no fees will be charged. Otherwise, a fixed fee that cannot be modified by users applies. The fee is charged in the same token type as the asset.</Note>
9. (Optional) Add a category or description to your transaction. For more details, refer to [Add category and description](/en/portal/transfers/add-category).
10. Click **Submit**.
11. Approve the request on your Cobo Guard. 

<Info>If the destination address is neither an address in your Address Book nor any of your Cobo wallets, you will be prompted to add the address to your Address Book.</Info>
