## C
#### Cobo Safe
Cobo Safe is a smart contract built on the [Safe Module](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-modules), which extends the functionality of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; while keeping module logic separate from Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;'s core contracts. When integrated with Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;, Cobo Safe enables role-based access controls, allowing tasks to be delegated to externally owned accounts (EOAs). These accounts can perform actions that have been pre-authorized by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers using a single signature.

## D
#### Delegate Key
The Delegate Key is used to initiate, but not sign, multi-sig transactions on behalf of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers. It is a unique address created by Cobo and automatically assigned to you during the Delegate Key setup.

#### Delegate
Delegates can perform actions authorized by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers using a single signature. This authorization is granted when you create on-chain transaction policies for your Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;) on Cobo Portal. Delegates can be addresses from either MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled) or externally owned accounts (EOAs) outside of Cobo Portal.

## I
#### Initiator address
The initiator address is used to cover the fees for creating a Smart Contract Wallet (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;) on Cobo Portal. The initiator address must be from an MPC Wallet (Organization-Controlled).

## M
#### Multi-sig transaction
A multi-signature (multi-sig) transaction requires multiple key share holders to sign the transaction before it can be executed, rather than relying on a single signature from one key.

## O
#### On-chain transaction policy
On-chain transaction policies are managed by smart contracts on blockchain networks. These policies let you define rules that control how transactions are handled and approved. Please note that on-chain transaction policies must be configured before you can make withdrawals or interact with dApps using your Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;).

## S
#### Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;
Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; is a leading multi-signature wallet and platform for securely storing digital assets on Ethereum and other popular EVM chains.

#### Signer address
The addresses of participants who are authorized to initiate, sign, and execute transactions within a Smart Contract Wallet (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;). On Cobo Portal, the signer addresses can be from either MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled) or external owned accounts (EOAs) outside of Cobo Portal.

#### Single-sig transaction
A single-signature (single-sig) transaction requires just one key share holder to sign a transaction before it can be executed.

#### Smart contract wallet
Smart contract wallets are a type of decentralized application (dApp) built on blockchain technology, allowing users to manage digital assets through programmable smart contracts.

## T
#### Threshold
The threshold of a Smart Contract Wallet (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;) defines the number of signer addresses that must approve a transaction before it can be executed.
