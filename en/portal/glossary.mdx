## C
#### Cobo Safe
Cobo Safe is a smart contract built on the [Safe Module](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-modules), which extends the functionality of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; while keeping module logic separate from Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;'s core contracts. When integrated with Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;, Cobo Safe enables role-based access controls, allowing tasks to be delegated to externally owned accounts (EOAs). These accounts can perform actions that have been pre-authorized by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers using a single signature.

## D
#### Delegate Key
The Delegate Key is used to initiate, but not sign, multi-sig transactions on behalf of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers. It is a unique address created by Cobo and automatically assigned to you during the Delegate Key setup.

#### Delegate
Delegates can perform actions authorized by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers using a single signature. This authorization is granted when you create on-chain transaction policies for your Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;) on Cobo Portal. Delegates can be addresses from either MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled) or externally owned accounts (EOAs) outside of Cobo Portal.

## I
#### Initiator address
The initiator address is used to cover the fees for creating a Smart Contract Wallet (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;) on Cobo Portal. The initiator address must be from an MPC Wallet (Organization-Controlled).

## M
#### Main Account
The primary account in an Exchange Wallet that holds full control over all assets and operations within its associated Sub Accounts.

#### MPC Wallets
A wallet type that uses Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology to secure digital assets. Cobo offers two types of MPC Wallets: Organization-Controlled Wallets and User-Controlled Wallets.

### Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
A cryptographic technology used for key management on the blockchain. With MPC, key shares are created separately in secure environments, encrypted, and shared among multiple parties. These parties will jointly sign transactions without ever revealing their key shares or materializing a full private key at any time.

#### Multi-sig transaction
A multi-signature (multi-sig) transaction requires multiple key share holders to sign the transaction before it can be executed, rather than relying on a single signature from one key.

## O

#### Off-chain transaction policy
Off-chain transaction policies in Cobo Portal are managed on the backend, allowing you to define rules that govern the handling and approval of transactions. These policies can control transaction limits, frequency, whitelists, and more.

#### On-chain transaction policy
On-chain transaction policies are managed by smart contracts on blockchain networks. These policies let you define rules that control how transactions are handled and approved. Please note that on-chain transaction policies must be configured before you can make withdrawals or interact with dApps using your Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;).

#### Organization
A top-level entity in Cobo Portal. Each organization independently manages its wallets, policies, and operations within the Cobo Portal ecosystem.

#### Organization-Controlled Wallets
A type of MPC Wallets where the ownership and management of digital assets lie with the organization.

## S
#### Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;
Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; is a leading multi-signature wallet and platform for securely storing digital assets on Ethereum and other popular EVM chains.

#### Signer address
The addresses of participants who are authorized to initiate, sign, and execute transactions within a Smart Contract Wallet (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;). On Cobo Portal, the signer addresses can be from either MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled) or external owned accounts (EOAs) outside of Cobo Portal.

#### Single-sig transaction
A single-signature (single-sig) transaction requires just one key share holder to sign a transaction before it can be executed.

#### Smart contract wallet
Smart contract wallets are a type of decentralized application (dApp) built on blockchain technology, allowing users to manage digital assets through programmable smart contracts.

## T
#### Threshold
The threshold of a Smart Contract Wallet (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;) defines the number of signer addresses that must approve a transaction before it can be executed.
