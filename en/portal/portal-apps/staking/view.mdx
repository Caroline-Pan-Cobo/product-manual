## Staking positions

In the **Staking Positions** section, you can view details of your staking positions in rows, including staked amount, maturity date, withdrawable amount, and position status.

**Position Status** depends on the result of your staking operations. For detailed explanations, see the documentation for [stake](/en/portal/portal-apps/staking/stake), [unstake](/en/portal/portal-apps/staking/unstake), and [withdraw](/en/portal/portal-apps/staking/withdraw).

You can click the row of a staking position to view more details, including **Position ID** and **Activity Timeline**. In the **Activity Timeline** section, click the blue hyperlinked text (for example, **BTC Confirmation**) to view the detailed status of the step.

## Activity

In the **Activity** section, you can view the history of your staking operations and their status.

**Activity Status** depends on the result of your staking operations. For BTC staking with Babylon, the **Activity Status** stays as **Processing** before the transaction is confirmed by Babylon. If the transaction is rejected by risk control policies or signers, the status will be **Failed**. If it passes, depending on whether Babylon confirms the transaction, the final status will be **Success** or **Failed**.

<Info>Withdrawal does not require confirmation from Babylon; the status will be **Success** when it goes on-chain.</Info>

You can click the row of an activity to view more details, including **Position ID** and **Timeline**. In the **Timeline** section, click the blue hyperlinked text (for example, **BTC Confirmation**) to view the detailed status of the step.
