## Introduction to Fee Reserve

Fee Reserve is used to cover on-chain transaction fees in SuperLoop incurred during the following types of transactions:

1. Outgoing Settlement: Transactions from SuperLoop to exchanges. Note that outgoing settlement transactions with some exchanges won't incur on-chain transaction fees.
2. Incoming Settlement: Auto transfers of settled assets from SuperLoop to your [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction).
3. User-Initiated Withdrawals: Withdrawals made from SuperLoop to your MPC Wallets.

**Notes:**
1. The Fee Reserve is shared by all of your exchange accounts.
2. You can deposit to or withdraw from your Fee Reserve at any time.
