## Overview

User-Controlled Wallets are primarily set up through the [Cobo Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS) 2.0 API](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/overview/introduction) and [UCW SDK](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/developer-tools/quickstart-ucw-ios). We also have demo codes to help you get started. For a complete guide on implementing your own User-Controlled Wallets, see [Get started with MPC Wallets (User-Controlled Wallets)](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ucw) in our Developer Hub.

Once you've set up your User-Controlled Wallets, you can use the Cobo Portal to manage them by following the instructions in the next sections.
