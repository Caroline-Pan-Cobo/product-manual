## What are User-Controlled Wallets

User-Controlled Wallets are a subtype of [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction). In a User-Controlled Wallet, end users of your [organization](/en/portal/organization/introduction) are given full control of their digital assets. In this setup, each end user of your organization holds their own unique private key share to their MPC Wallets.

With a flexible [Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction#threshold-signature-scheme-tss) (”m out of n” key shares), User-Controlled Wallets allow your organization to customize how transactions are signed. For example, under a 3-3 signature scheme, your organization, your end user, and Cobo each hold a key share, and all three key shares must collectively sign transactions. Alternatively, a 2-3 signature scheme can be implemented, where your organization’s key share is held offline and utilized only in specific circumstances, such as disputes or critical events.

To integrate non-custodial MPC Wallets into your applications, a 2-2 signature can be implemented, where your end user and Cobo each hold a key share, while your organization holds none.
