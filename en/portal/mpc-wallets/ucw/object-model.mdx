### Project

A project is a collection of vaults.

### Vault

A vault is a collection of User-Controlled Wallets sharing the same root extended private key.

### Root Extended Private Key

Each vault is associated with a unique root extended private key. This master private key is used within the MPC framework to generate a series of key shares. Each set of key shares is referred to as a [holder group (or key share holder group)](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-key-share-groups).

You can set up multiple projects, vaults, and wallets to meet the specific requirements of your business.
