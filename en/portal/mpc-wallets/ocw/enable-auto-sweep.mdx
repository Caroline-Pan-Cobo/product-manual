This guide explains how to enable the auto sweep feature for an Organization-Controlled Wallet on Cobo Portal. For more details about auto sweep, refer to [Introduction to auto sweep](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/auto-sweep-overview).

## Prerequisites
- You have created an MPC Wallet (Organization-Controlled Wallet) and set it up as described in [Overview](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/set-up).
- You have set up a server co-signer for auto sweep transactions as described in [Introduction to server co-signers](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/tss-node-overview). Otherwise, you will need to sign auto sweep transactions manually on Cobo Guard.
- You have been assigned the role of "Admin", "Operator", "Manager" or an equivalent [role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) with the permission "Edit Auto Sweep".
- Transaction fees apply to the withdrawal part of the sweep transaction. It is recommended to enable Fee Station for transaction fee payments as described in [Set up Fee Station for Transaction Fee Payment of MPC Wallets](/en/portal/fee-station/set-up-for-mpc). Otherwise, you will need to ensure sufficient main chain coin balance at the receiving address.

## Steps

## Changes after enabling auto sweep

- Wallet list filtering: You can filter wallets by their **Auto-Sweep Enabled** status to easily identify which wallets have the feature turned on or off.

- Token list balance display: You can view your token balances in two columns: total balance and withdrawable balance (in the sweep address). Hover over the total balance to see both the withdrawable and unswept balances, and hover over the withdrawable balance to view the sweep address.

- Address list organization: You can find addresses organized into two tabs: **Deposit** and **Sweep-to**. The **Deposit** tab displays previously created receiving addresses, while the **Sweep-to** tab lists addresses created by Cobo for sweep transactions.

- Transaction history changes: When an auto sweep occurs, you will see two transaction records. For receiving addresses, it's recorded as a **withdraw**. For sweep addresses, it's recorded as a **deposit**.
