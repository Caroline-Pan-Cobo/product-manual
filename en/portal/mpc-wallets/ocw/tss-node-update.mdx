When new versions of the TSS Node are released, it is highly recommended to stay updated by upgrading to the latest version. For major releases involving key feature upgrades, Coboâ€™s customer support will provide advance notification. After downloading a new version of the TSS Node package, please ensure to complete the following steps.

1. Stop the old TSS Node. 

```
sudo ./tss-node.sh stop
```

2. Back up key data (e.g. db/secrets.db, passwords, config files, and keys under configs/).

3. Unzip the new version of the TSS Node package and overwrite the files in the old version. Ensure that the new version is unzipped in the same folder used by the previous TSS Node. 

```
tar -xzf cobo-tss-node-generic.tgz
```

4. To ensure the proper functioning of the TSS Node, check its operating environment and pull the necessary container images.

```
sudo ./tss-node.sh status
```

5. Initiate the new version of the TSS Node, and verify its successful startup by ensuring that the version number and key data (such as the TSS Node ID) in the log match the expected values.

```
sudo ./tss-node.sh start
```
