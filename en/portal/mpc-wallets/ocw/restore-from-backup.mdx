**Note**: If the locally stored key share is lost, the key share holder can restore it utilizing the backed-up data file, provided that the file remains unaltered and accessible. Restoration in this context refers to the ability of a key share holder to retrieve their key share independently, without requiring assistance from any other holder groups.
