**Note**: If the locally stored private key share is lost and the backed-up data file is no longer accessible, the key share holder can recover their private key share with the assistance of another active holder group. Unlike restoration, recovery relies on the support from another holder group.

## If Main Group is lost or compromised

Upgrade an active Signing Group to function as the Main Group. The original Main Group will be automatically deleted. For more information, please refer to [Manage Signing Groups](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups#manage-signing-groups).
