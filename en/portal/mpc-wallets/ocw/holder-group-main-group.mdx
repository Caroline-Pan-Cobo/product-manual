## Main Group
Creating a Main Group is mandatory before you can create an MPC Wallet. You may begin to use the MPC Wallet once the Main Group is successfully created. As best security practices and to ensure the utmost safety for your assets, it is a good idea to set up your Signing Group and Recovery Group as soon as you can, and back up all holder groups. You can create multiple Signing Groups to cater to your business requirements, but it is recommended to create only one Recovery Group. (Best security practices for your holder groups available soon on our Developer Hub.)

### Create a Main Group <a id="create-a-main-group"></a>
When creating the Main Group for your MPC vault, you have the option to choose either mobile co-signer or API co-signer. Make sure you understand the primary purposes and prerequisites of each co-signer type in the table below before proceeding further.

<a id="signer-type"></a>
<table class="six-columns">
  <tr>
    <th>Co-Signer Type</th>
    <th>Mobile Co-Signer</th>
    <th>API Co-Signer</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Primary Purposes</td>
    <td>
      The mobile co-signer is an organization member who uses [Cobo Guard](/en/guard/introduction) to securely sign transactions. Their TSS Node ID is generated by their Cobo Guard. <Note>If you are using the [WaaS 2.0 API](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/overview/introduction) to create a holder group, you can copy the TSS Node ID in your Cobo Guard by tapping <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_menu.svg" className="icon"></img> > <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_key.svg" className="icon"></img> **My Public Key** > **TSS Node ID** > **Copy TSS Node ID**.</Note>
    </td>
    <td>
      The API co-signer is a server node that utilizes the [TSS Node package](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/network-environments) to automatically sign transactions. Its TSS Node ID is generated using the provided TSS Node software package and must be done before setting up the wallet. See <a href="/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/network-environments">TSS Node Technical Setup</a> for further instructions.

      Your chosen key share holders need to provide you with their generated TSS Node ID. See <a href="/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/network-environments">TSS Node Technical Setup</a> for further instructions.

After you've chosen a co-signer type and set up the prerequisites, follow the instructions below to create a Main Group. **Note:** Only the users who have been assigned [the Operator user role in the organization](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) can create a Main Group.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.

4. On the **Create Main Group** dialog, navigate to the **Key Share Holder 2** section, and then complete the following configurations: <a id="on-the-create-main-group-dialog"></a>
    - To use **Mobile Co-Signer**, select a **Holder** (the **TSS Node ID** will be filled in automatically), then click **Confirm**.

    - To use **API Co-Signer**, enter a **Holder** name, fill in the **TSS Node ID** generated using the TSS Node software package, then click **Confirm**. See [TSS Node Technical Setup](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/network-environments) for further instructions.

5. Inform the relevant key share holder to confirm on their end.
    - **Notes:**
        - If using mobile co-signer, a **Confirmation** page appears on Cobo Portal. Please remind the selected key share holder to to confirm in their Cobo Guard. On the selected key share holder's Cobo Guard app, tap the **Security Verification** message to open the **Security Verification** page. Review the information, then click **Yes, it is me**. A **Become Key Holder** message will soon then be sent to the key share holder's Cobo Guard, click it to open the **Become Key Holder** page, review the information, then click **Approve**. Selected key share holder should now tap the **Generate Key Shares** banner on their Cobo Guard to enter the **My Account** page, tap **Pending Key Generation** under **Key Shares** to enter the **Key Shares** page. On the **Key Shares** page, click **Start** to enter the **Generate Key Shares** page. The key generation process will begin. Click **OK** when the **Key Generation Success** message is displayed on Cobo Guard.
        - If using API co-signer, ensure to bring the TSS Node online within 24 hours. The confirmation process is completed as soon as the TSS Node goes online.

6. Once the key generation process is completed in step 5, the **Group Status** will show as **Active**.
 <Info>You might need to refresh the Cobo Portal page to see the updated result.</Info>
 <Info>A default wallet will be automatically created for this vault upon successful key generation.</Info>
