After youâ€™ve created one or many of the [3 types of holder groups](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-overview), it is a good idea to have key share holders back up their keys. Key share holders back up their key shares differently depending on whether the key shares were generated using a mobile co-signer or a server co-signer.

## Mobile co-signer
Key share holders can use the Cobo Guard app they used to confirm the key group creation process to back up any key shares created on their Cobo Guard. See [Generate and back up your key shares](/en/guard/generate-and-back-up-key-shares).

## Server co-signer
Key share holders can back up their key shares using the server co-signer. The instructions will become available on Developer Hub in the future.
