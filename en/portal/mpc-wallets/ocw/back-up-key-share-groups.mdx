After youâ€™ve created one or many of the [3 types of holder groups](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-key-share-groups), it is a good idea to have key share holders back up their keys. Key share holders back up their key shares differently depending on whether the key shares were generated using a mobile co-signer or an API co-signer.

## Mobile co-signer
Key share holders can use the Cobo Guard app they used to confirm the key group creation process to back up any key shares created on their Cobo Guard. See [Generate and back up your key shares](/en/guard/generate-and-back-up-key-shares).

## API co-signer
Key share holders can back up their key shares using the API co-signer. The instructions will become available on Developer Hub in the future.
