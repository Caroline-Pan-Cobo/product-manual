## What are Organization-Controlled Wallets?

Organization-Controlled Wallets are a subtype of [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction). Organization-Controlled Wallets are MPC-based wallets where the management and control of the digital assets lie with the organization itself.

By leveraging MPC technology, the private key is fragmented into encrypted shares that are distributed among multiple parties. This approach enhances security and enables organizations to maintain full control over their funds or the assets of their end users. Organization-Controlled Wallets use a 2-2 signature scheme for transaction signing, where the organization and Cobo each hold a key share.
