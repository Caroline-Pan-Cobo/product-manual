## What are Organization-Controlled Wallets?

Organization-Controlled Wallets are a subtype of [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction). Organization-Controlled Wallets are MPC-based wallets where the management and control of the digital assets lie with the organization itself. By leveraging MPC technology to fragment the private key into encrypted shares distributed across multiple parties, organizations can enhance security and maintain complete control over their own funds or the assets of their end users. Organization-Controlled Wallets utilize a 2-2 signature scheme, where the organization and Cobo each hold a key share for transaction signing.

Organization-Controlled Wallets are created within an Organization-Controlled vault. Each Organization-Controlled vault corresponds to a root extended private key (essentially, the master private key in the MPC framework will generate a series of child keys for each corresponding vault). You can set up multiple vaults, and create multiple wallets under each vault to meet the specific requirements of your business.
