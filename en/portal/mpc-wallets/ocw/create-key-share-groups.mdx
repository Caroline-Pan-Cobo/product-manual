After creating a vault, you now need to create holder groups. There are 3 types of holder groups: Main Group, Signing Group, and Recovery Group.

## Main Group
Creating a Main Group is mandatory before you can create an MPC Wallet. You may begin to use the MPC Wallet once the Main Group is successfully created. As best security practices and to ensure the utmost safety for your assets, it is a good idea to set up your Signing Group and Recovery Group as soon as you can, and back up all holder groups. You can create multiple Signing Groups to cater to your business requirements, but it is recommended to create only one Recovery Group. (Best security practices for your holder groups available soon on our Developer Hub.)

### Create a Main Group <a id="create-a-main-group"></a>
When creating the Main Group for your MPC vault, you have the option to choose either mobile co-signer or API co-signer. Make sure you understand the primary purposes and prerequisites of each co-signer type in the table below before proceeding further.


<a id="signer-type"></a>
<table class="six-columns">
  <tr>
    <th>Co-Signer Type</th>
    <th>Mobile Co-Signer</th>
    <th>API Co-Signer</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Primary Purposes</td>
    <td>
      The mobile co-signer is an organization member who uses [Cobo Guard](/en/guard/introduction) to securely sign transactions. Their TSS Node ID is generated by their Cobo Guard and will be automatically filled. <Note>If you were redirected here from our [WaaS 2.0 API](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/overview/introduction) articles, you can copy the TSS Node ID in your Cobo Guard by tapping <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_menu.svg" className="icon"></img> > <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_key.svg" className="icon"></img> **My Public Key** > **TSS Node ID** > **Copy TSS Node ID**.</Note>
    </td>
    <td>
      The API co-signer is a server node that utilizes the [TSS Node package](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/network-environments) to automatically sign transactions. Its TSS Node ID is generated using the provided TSS Node software package and must be done before setting up the wallet. See <a href="/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/network-environments">TSS Node Technical Setup</a> for further instructions.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Prerequisite Steps</td>
    <td>
      Your chosen key share holders need to:
      <ol>
        <li><a href="/en/guard/download">Download Cobo Guard</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="/en/accounts/set-up-mfa#set-up-cobo-guard">Set up Cobo Guard as a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method of their Cobo Accounts</a>.</li>
        <li>Be <a href="/en/portal/organization/manage-members">added to your organization as a member</a>.</li>
      </ol>
    </td>
    <td>
      Your chosen key share holders need to provide you with their generated TSS Node ID. See <a href="/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/network-environments">TSS Node Technical Setup</a> for further instructions.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


After you've chosen a co-signer type and set up the prerequisites, follow the instructions below to create a Main Group. **Note:** Only the users who have been assigned [the Operator user role in the organization](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) can create a Main Group.


1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click **Create Main Group** under the vault name.
<img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/create-main-key-group.png" className="screenshot_full_screen"/>
4. On the **Create Main Group** dialog, navigate to the **Key Share Holder 2** section, and then complete the following configurations: <a id="on-the-create-main-group-dialog"></a>
    - To use **Mobile Co-Signer**, select a **Holder** (the **TSS Node ID** will be filled in automatically), then click **Confirm**.

    - To use **API Co-Signer**, enter a **Holder** name, fill in the **TSS Node ID** generated using the TSS Node software package, then click **Confirm**. See [TSS Node Technical Setup](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/network-environments) for further instructions.

5. Inform the relevant key share holder to confirm on their end.
    - **Notes:**
        - If using mobile co-signer, a **Confirmation** page appears on Cobo Portal. Please remind the selected key share holder to to confirm in their Cobo Guard. On the selected key share holder's Cobo Guard app, tap the **Security Verification** message to open the **Security Verification** page. Review the information, then click **Yes, it is me**. A **Become Key Holder** message will soon then be sent to the key share holder's Cobo Guard, click it to open the **Become Key Holder** page, review the information, then click **Approve**. Selected key share holder should now tap the **Generate Key Shares** banner on their Cobo Guard to enter the **My Account** page, tap **Pending Key Generation** under **Key Shares** to enter the **Key Shares** page. On the **Key Shares** page, click **Start** to enter the **Generate Key Shares** page. The key generation process will begin. Click **OK** when the **Key Generation Success** message is displayed on Cobo Guard.
        - If using API co-signer, ensure to bring the TSS Node online within 24 hours. The confirmation process is completed as soon as the TSS Node goes online.

6. Once the key generation process is completed in step 5, the **Group Status** will show as **Active**.
 <Info>You might need to refresh the Cobo Portal page to see the updated result.</Info>
 <Info>A default wallet will be automatically created for this vault upon successful key generation.</Info>

## Signing Group
Signing Groups are created using the Main Group. You can create multiple Signing Groups for different members depending on your business needs.

### Create a Signing Group
Similar to creating the Main Group, you have the option to choose either mobile co-signer or API co-signer when creating the Signing Group. Make sure you understand [the primary purposes and prerequisites of each co-signer type](#signer-type) before proceeding further.


After you've chosen a co-signer type and set up the prerequisites, follow the instructions below to create a Signing Group. **Note:** Only the users who have been assigned [the Operator user role in the organization](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) can create a Signing Group.


1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
4. In the **Key Group Management** page, click **Signing Groups** > **Create Signing Group**.

<img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/create-signing-group.png" className="screenshot_full_screen"/>

5. The Signing Group creation process is the same as the Main Group creation process. See [Create Main Group](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-key-share-groups#on-the-create-main-group-dialog) for detailed instructions.

### Manage Signing Group
#### Convert Signing Group into Main Group
In certain situations, you may want to convert a Signing Group into the Main Group. For example, if the current owner of the Main Group is leaving the organization and you need to assign a new person to own the Main Group, you may choose to convert a specific Signing Group into the new Main Group.

Follow the instructions below to convert a Signing Group into a Main Group.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
4. In the **Key Group Management** page, click **Signing Groups** and then select the Signing Group to be converted.
5. Click **Upgrade to Main Group**.

<img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/upgrade-to-main-group.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>

6. Click **Confirm** to upgrade the Signing Group to the Main Group.

7. The Signing Group is now the Main Group. **Note:** If there was only one Signing Group before the conversion, the list of Signing Groups will become empty post-conversion.

#### Delete a Signing Group
Follow the instructions below if you want to delete a Signing Group.


1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
4. In the **Key Group Management** page, click **Signing Groups** and then select the Signing Group to be deleted.
5. Click **Delete Group**.
<img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/delete-sign-group.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>

6. Click **Confirm** to delete the specified Signing Group.

7. The specified Signing Group is now deleted.

## Recovery Group
Recovery Groups serve two main purposes: Recover the whole private key and create a new Main Group if your Main Group and backup copy are lost or compromised. To learn more about backup and recovery, see [Back up holder groups](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/back-up-key-share-groups) and [Recover key shares](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/restore-from-backup).

Similar to creating the Main Group and Signing Group, you have the option to choose either mobile co-signer or API co-signer when creating the Recovery Group. Make sure you understand [the primary purposes and prerequisites of each co-signer type](#signer-type) before proceeding further.


After you've chosen a co-signer type and set up the prerequisites, follow the instructions below to create a Recovery Group. **Note:** Only the users who have been assigned [the Operator user role in the organization](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) can create a Recovery Group.

### Create a Recovery Group
 **Note:** You must first create the Main Group before creating a Recovery group. Follow the instructions below to create a Recovery Group.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.

<img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/recoverymode.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>
5. If you select **With Cobo Participation**, follow the instructions below to complete the creation:
- Select either **Self Recovery** or **Third-Party Recovery**. Self Recovery requires key shares held by Cobo and your Organization, while Third-Party Recovery requires key shares held by Cobo, your Organization, and your trusted third-party.
- Select your key share holders.
    - To use **Mobile Co-Signer**, select a **Holder** (the **TSS Node ID** will be filled in automatically).
    - To use **API Co-Signer**, enter a **Holder** name, fill in the **TSS Node ID** generated using the TSS Node software package.
<img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/recoverytype.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>
6. If you select **Without Cobo Participation**, follow the instructions below to complete the creation:
