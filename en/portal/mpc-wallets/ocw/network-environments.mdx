  - Able to access the apt sources of the system to install all necessary dependencies (only applicable if a SGX-ready server or a general server is used)
  - Able to access the Docker Engine installation files to install the Docker Engine
  - Able to access docker.io registry (the public Docker registry)
  - Able to access the Intel website to download the driver (applicable to a SGX-ready server)
- When the server is running:
  - Development environment: able to access port 443 of ws.tss.dev.cobo.com
  - Production environment: able to access port 443 of ws.tss.cobo.com
  - Able to access the callback server set up by the client
