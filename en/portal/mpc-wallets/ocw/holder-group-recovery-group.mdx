## Recovery Group
Recovery Groups serve two main purposes: Recover the whole private key and create a new Main Group if your Main Group and backup copy are lost or compromised. To learn more about backup and recovery, see [Back up holder groups](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/back-up-key-share-groups) and [Recover key shares](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/restore-from-backup).

Similar to creating the Main Group and Signing Group, you have the option to choose either mobile co-signer or Server co-signer when creating the Recovery Group. Make sure you understand [the primary purposes and prerequisites of each co-signer type](#signer-type) before proceeding further.

After you've chosen a co-signer type and set up the prerequisites, follow the instructions below to create a Recovery Group. **Note:** Only the users who have been assigned [the Operator user role in the organization](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) can create a Recovery Group.

### Create a Recovery Group
 **Note:** You must first create the Main Group before creating a Recovery group. Follow the instructions below to create a Recovery Group.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
4. In the pop-up window, select a Recovery Group mode and click **Confirm**.
- With Cobo Participation: A 2-3 signature scheme will be used. Cobo holds one key share, and the remaining two key shares are held either exclusively by your Organization or jointly with a third party.
- Without Cobo Participation: A 2-2 signature scheme will be used. Cobo does not hold any key shares. The two key shares are held either exclusively by your Organization or jointly with a third party.

5. If you select **With Cobo Participation**, follow the instructions below to complete the creation:

- Select your key share holders.
    - To use **Mobile Co-Signer**, select a **Holder** (the **TSS Node ID** will be filled in automatically).
    - To use **Server Co-Signer**, enter a **Holder** name, fill in the **TSS Node ID** generated using the TSS Node software package.

9. Once all key share holders have confirmed on their Cobo Guard apps, wait for the key generation process to conclude, then the Recovery Group will be created.
