## Signing Group
Signing Groups are created using the Main Group. You can create multiple Signing Groups for different members depending on your business needs.

### Create a Signing Group
Similar to creating the Main Group, you have the option to choose either mobile co-signer or API co-signer when creating the Signing Group. Make sure you understand [the primary purposes and prerequisites of each co-signer type](#signer-type) before proceeding further.

After you've chosen a co-signer type and set up the prerequisites, follow the instructions below to create a Signing Group. **Note:** Only the users who have been assigned [the Operator user role in the organization](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) can create a Signing Group.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
4. In the **Key Group Management** page, click **Signing Groups** > **Create Signing Group**.

5. The Signing Group creation process is the same as the Main Group creation process. See [Create Main Group](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-key-share-groups#on-the-create-main-group-dialog) for detailed instructions.

### Manage Signing Group
#### Convert Signing Group into Main Group
In certain situations, you may want to convert a Signing Group into the Main Group. For example, if the current owner of the Main Group is leaving the organization and you need to assign a new person to own the Main Group, you may choose to convert a specific Signing Group into the new Main Group.

Follow the instructions below to convert a Signing Group into a Main Group.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
4. In the **Key Group Management** page, click **Signing Groups** and then select the Signing Group to be converted.
5. Click **Upgrade to Main Group**.

6. Click **Confirm** to upgrade the Signing Group to the Main Group.

7. The Signing Group is now the Main Group. **Note:** If there was only one Signing Group before the conversion, the list of Signing Groups will become empty post-conversion.

#### Delete a Signing Group
Follow the instructions below if you want to delete a Signing Group.
