1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click your name in the bottom left corner, then select **Organization** > **Fee Station**.
3. Switch to the **Transaction Records** tab. Currently, there are three types of transaction records.
- **Transaction Fee Payment**: This refers to the transaction fee that Fee Station automatically pays to an address in your MPC Wallets.
- **Cobo Bill Payment**: This refers to the payment of Cobo bills that Fee Station automatically settles. For Cobo bills, Fee Station accepts payments in the following asset types, deducted in this order: TRON_USDC, TRON_USDT, ETH_USDC, and ETH_USDT. You can use one or more of these assets for your payment. For example, if a Cobo bill amounts to 300 USD and your Fee Station balance includes 100 TRON_USDC, 50 TRON_USDT, and 40,000 ETH_USDC only, the payment will be processed as follows and three transaction records will be created:
    - 100 TRON_USDC will be deducted first.
    - 50 TRON_USDT will be deducted next.
    - The remaining amount, which is 150 USD, will be deducted from ETH_USDC.
- **Refund**:
    - If a TRON transaction initiated from your MPC Wallet fails, the transaction fee will be refunded to your Fee Station. However, for failed MPC transactions on EVM chains, the transaction fee will remain in your MPC Wallet and will not be refunded to the Fee Station.
    - A refund may also be issued for Cobo bills.
