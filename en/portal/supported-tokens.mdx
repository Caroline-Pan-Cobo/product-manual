## Request self-listing for unsupported tokens

### Why request token self-listing?

The crypto ecosystem is dynamic, with new tokens emerging frequently. Our token self-listing feature empowers you to quickly add tokens that aren't yet supported by Cobo Portal. This feature is particularly valuable for:

- **Exchanges & Trading Teams**
  - Quickly list emerging tokens or trending assets (like meme coins) for time-sensitive trading opportunities
  - Maintain competitive advantage with fast token listing capabilities
  - Manage custom token portfolios efficiently



### How to request for token self-listing
For tokens that are not currently supported in Cobo Portal, we now offer a self-listing request feature that allows you to request the addition of new tokens.

Below is a quick overview of the process:
