<Info>Due to the Bybit security incident, Safe Wallet has suspended third-party delegate call services. As a result, Cobo's Smart Contract Wallets and related services (including on-chain transaction policies) are temporarily unavailable. However, existing wallets and on-chain transaction policies can still be used. Recovery timeline will be announced later.</Info>

<Note>Prerequisite: Before withdrawing from Smart Contract Wallets, please make sure that you have [created](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/create) or [imported](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/import) a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;, set up an [on-chain transaction policy](/cn/portal/risk-controls/on-chain-tx-type) for token transfers, set up an [off-chain transaction policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer) (recommended), and [deposited funds](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/deposit-assets) into the wallet.</Note>
