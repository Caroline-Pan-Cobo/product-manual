## What are Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;)?

Smart contract wallets are decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain technology, allowing users to manage their digital assets through programmable smart contracts. These wallets give users the ability to keep their crypto assets in self-custody.

Cobo Portalâ€™s Smart Contract Wallets support the direct creation and import of [Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;](https://safe.global/wallet), a leading Ethereum multi-signature wallet, and provide granular on-chain access controls through Cobo Safe, a smart contract built on [Safe Modules](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-modules).

When integrated with Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; as a plug-in, Cobo Safe enables role-based access controls, allowing you to delegate operations to externally owned accounts (EOAs). These accounts can perform specific actions authorized by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers using just one signature, significantly improving operational efficiency. At the same time, the multi-signature mechanism of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; removes any single point of failure, ensuring the complete security of your funds.
