4. You will be redirected to the Transaction History homepage.
5. Connect the initiator address you selected when creating this Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; and then sign a message. Do note that this initiator address will be used to cover the network fees associated with creating your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
6. Your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; will be successfully initiated once the signing process is complete.
7. Return to the Smart Contract Wallets homepage, where the status of your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; will now be automatically updated to **Setup Required**. You may now proceed to Step 2.

## Step 2: Set up Delegate Key

The Delegate Key is used to initiate, but not sign, multi-sig transactions on behalf of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers. It is a dedicated address created and assigned by Cobo.

1. On the Smart Contract Wallets homepage, click **Setup Required** > **Set Up** next to your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.

3. If you are not the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signer:
- Click <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_copy.svg" className="icon"></img> to copy the link shown in the pop-up window. Then, send it to any of your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers to sign.
- Alternatively, click **Copy All and Close** to copy all information, including the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; address, Delegate Key, and URL.

4. If you are the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signer:
- Navigate to the link provided and connect to your wallet associated with this Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
- In the pop-up window, review the auto-filled fields and enter a label for this Delegate Key. Then, click **Sign Message**.
- Sign a message in your connected wallet.

5. The new Delegate Key will be displayed on the homepage. You may now proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3: Create an on-chain transaction policy
1. On the Smart Contract Wallets homepage, click **Setup Required** > **Create** next to your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.

2. Select the type of on-chain transaction policy you want to create. Note that creating an on-chain transaction policy requires you to select Delegates. Upon successful creation of this on-chain transaction policy, you authorize these Delegates to perform certain tasks (e.g., token transfers, token approvals, contract calls) using a single-signature.
3. Click **Next**.
4. Set up an on-chain transaction policy. For step-to-step guides, refer to [Create contract call policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/create-on-chain-policy).

#### What is a Delegate?

Delegate can either be an address from your MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled), Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets), or an EOA address. It is pre-authorized by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers to perform single-signature operations, such as transferring funds or interacting with dApps. Importantly, the Delegate is responsible for handling gas fees during the execution of single-signature transactions.

On Cobo Portal, you can set up Delegates by creating on-chain transaction policies for Smart Contract Wallets. The addresses entered during setup will automatically be designated as Delegates for performing single-signature operations.
