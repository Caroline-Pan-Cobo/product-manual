User roles consist of predefined sets of rules that allow you to assign specific permissions to designated members within your organization. Cobo offers preset roles, and you can also create additional roles tailored to your specific requirements. To learn more about user roles and permissions, see [Introduction to user roles and permissions](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions).
