You can effortlessly set up and edit off-chain transaction policies. Note that off-chain transaction policies are managed by the backend system of Cobo Portal. You can also automate how each transaction will be handled by setting up an approval action. This could include auto approval, auto rejection, approval quorum, and customized workflows. For details, see [Introduction to transaction policies](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview).
