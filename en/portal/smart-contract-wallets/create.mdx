<Note>Currently, creating a Smart Contract Wallet on Cobo Portal is akin to setting up a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; with Cobo Safe enabled.</Note>

## Steps

1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_wallet.svg" className="icon"></img> > **Smart Contract Wallets** > <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_create.svg" className="icon"></img>.
3. In the pop-up window, select a network where your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; will be based.
4. Enter a name for your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
5. Select signer addresses. These addresses will be used to sign multi-sig transactions on the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
- My Wallets: Select addresses from your MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled).
- Address Book: Select MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled) or EOA addresses listed in your Address Book.
- Other: Manually enter EOA addresses.
6. Enter a signing threshold. The threshold in a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; specifies the number of signers required to sign a multi-sig transaction before it can be executed
7. Enter an optional label for your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;. Please note that your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; address will only be added to the Address Book if you provide a label in this step.
8. Select an initiator address from your MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled). This address will be used to cover the network fee when creating your new Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
9. Click **Next**.
