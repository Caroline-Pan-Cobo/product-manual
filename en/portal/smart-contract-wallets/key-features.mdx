## Efficient single-signature fund transfers
Effortlessly execute fund transfers using a single-signature scheme, representing a boost in efficiency from the multi-signature scheme when utilizing Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.

## Off-chain and on-chain transaction policies
Exercise full control over transaction policies for your Smart Contract Wallets, extending beyond off-chain to cover on-chain transaction policies. With off-chain transaction policies, ensure robust security by setting up configurable policies for token transfers and contract calls. With on-chain transaction policies, authorize specific actions to be safely executed by Delegates, who can then sign these actions using a simple single-signature transaction.

## Seamless interactions with dApps
Easily connect to your favorite dApps with Cobo Connectâ€”a powerful Chrome extension that serves as your gateway between Cobo Portal and the dApp ecosystem.
