<Info>Due to the Bybit security incident, Safe Wallet has suspended third-party delegate call services. As a result, Cobo's Smart Contract Wallets and related services (including on-chain transaction policies) are temporarily unavailable. However, existing wallets and on-chain transaction policies can still be used. Recovery timeline will be announced later.</Info>

<Note>Only the Operator and Spender have permission to import a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;. Cobo Portal currently does not support deleting Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; once it has been imported.</Note>

## Step 1: Import a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;

#### If your current email address _is_ associated with a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; in Cobo Argus

1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_wallet.svg" className="icon"></img> > **Smart Contract Wallets** > <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_import.svg" className="icon"></img>.

6. You have successfully imported a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;. You may now proceed to Step 2.

#### If your current email address _is not_ associated with any Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; in Cobo Argus

1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_wallet.svg" className="icon"></img> > **Smart Contract Wallets** > <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_import.svg" className="icon"></img>.
3. In the pop-up window, select Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/safe wallet.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
4. Enter the address of the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; you want to import into Cobo Portal. Your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; instances will load automatically.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/load.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
5. Select the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; instance you want to import. Then, click **Import**.
6. You have successfully imported a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;. You may now proceed to Step 2.

## Step 2: Set up a Delegate Key

The Delegate Key is used to initiate, but not sign, multi-sig transactions on behalf of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers. It is a dedicated address created and assigned by Cobo.

1. In the pop-up window, click **Set Up**.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/import success.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
2. Click **Set Up Delegate Key**.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/set up delegate key.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
3. If you are not the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signer:
- Click <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_copy.svg" className="icon"></img> to copy the link shown in the pop-up window. Then, send it to any of your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers to sign.
- Alternatively, click **Copy All and Close** to copy all information, including the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; address, Delegate Key, and URL.

4. If you are the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signer:
- Navigate to the link provided and connect to your wallet associated with this Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
- In the pop-up window, review the auto-filled fields and enter a label for this Delegate Key. Then, click **Sign Message**.
- Sign a message in your connected wallet.

5. The new Delegate Key will be displayed on the homepage. You may now proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3: Create an on-chain transaction policy
1. On the Smart Contract Wallets homepage, navigate to Status and click **Setup Required** > **Create** next to your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/create policy.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
2. Select the type of on-chain transaction policy you want to create. Note that creating an on-chain transaction policy requires you to select Delegates. Upon successful creation of this on-chain transaction policy, you authorize these Delegates to perform certain tasks (e.g., token transfers, token approvals, contract calls) using a single-signature.

3. Click **Next**.
4. Set up an on-chain transaction policy. For step-to-step guides, refer to [Create contract call policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/create-on-chain-policy).
5. (If applicable) If you imported an instance directly from Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; instead of Cobo Argus, you will be prompted to manually enable Cobo Safe, a smart contract framework that offers delegation and parameter-level access controls. Click **Confirm** to enable Cobo Safe and submit your policy in a single transaction.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/enable cobo safe.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
6. Complete the MFA verification.
7. A multi-sig confirmation from Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers is required. Please notify the signers to complete the transaction on Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
8. Once the multi-sig confirmation is complete, return to the Smart Contract Wallets homepage. The status of your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; will now be automatically updated to **Ready for use**.

#### What is a Delegate?

Delegate can either be an address from your MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled), Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets), or an EOA address. It is pre-authorized by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers to perform single-signature operations, such as transferring funds or interacting with dApps. Importantly, the Delegate is responsible for handling gas fees during the execution of single-signature transactions.

On Cobo Portal, you can set up Delegates by creating on-chain transaction policies for Smart Contract Wallets. The addresses entered during setup will automatically be designated as Delegates for performing single-signature operations.
