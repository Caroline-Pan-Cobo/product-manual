<Info>Due to the Bybit security incident, Safe Wallet has suspended third-party delegate call services. As a result, Cobo's Smart Contract Wallets and related services (including on-chain transaction policies) are temporarily unavailable. However, existing wallets and on-chain transaction policies can still be used. Recovery timeline will be announced later.</Info>

Note: Please make sure that you are sending tokens to the correct address and network. Any errors may result in the loss of funds.

## Deposit by assets

1. Click into a Smart Contract Wallet on Cobo Portal and switch to the **Assets** section.
2. To deposit a specific token, click <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_deposit.svg" className="icon"></img> next to the respective token (e.g., ETH). Please note that the tokens listed under Assets are automatically retrieved from your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; and cannot be modified on Cobo Portal.
3. In the pop-up window, either copy the deposit address for the corresponding token or scan the QR code. If you want to deposit from any of your wallets created on Cobo Portal, click **Deposit from other wallets** instead.
