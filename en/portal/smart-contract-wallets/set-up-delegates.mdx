<Note>Prerequisite: Please make sure that you have successfully [created](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/create) or [imported](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/import) a Smart Contract Wallet and [set up](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/set-up-delegate-keys) a Delegate Key.</Note>

1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_wallet.svg" className="icon"></img> > **Smart Contract Wallets**.
3. Click into a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; and switch to the **On-Chain Transaction Policies** tab.
4. Click <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_create policy.svg" className="icon"></img>.
5. Set up an on-chain transaction policy for token transfers. For step-to-step guides, refer to [Create contract call policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/create-on-chain-policy). Upon successful creation of an on-chain transaction policy, your selected Delegates will be authorized to perform single-signature operations such as token transfers and custom contract calls.

#### What is a Delegate?

Delegate can either be an address from your MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled) or an EOA address. It is pre-authorized by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers to perform single-signature operations, such as transferring funds or interacting with dApps. Importantly, the Delegate is responsible for handling gas fees during the execution of single-signature transactions.

On Cobo Portal, you can set up Delegates by creating on-chain transaction policies for Smart Contract Wallets. The addresses entered during setup will automatically be designated as Delegates for performing single-signature operations.
