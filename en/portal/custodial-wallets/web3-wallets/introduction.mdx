Web3 Wallets are a sub-wallet type of Custodial Wallets designed for interacting with the Web3 ecosystem, including DeFi, NFTs, and dApps. With Web3 Wallets, you can perform smart contract calls, asset approvals, and message signing, without managing private keys or deploying infrastructure.

Unlike Asset Wallets, which focus on centralized fund management, Web3 Wallets allow you to independently control each address. You can explicitly specify the source address for each transaction or interaction, giving you greater flexibility and clarity.

You can access Web3 Wallets through the Cobo Portal web interface or via WaaS 2.0 API. You can also use the [Cobo Connect](/en/cobo-connect/introduction) browser extension to securely connect your wallets to dApps and perform on-chain actions.

## Key features

### Full support for on-chain interaction  
Use your Web3 Wallets to securely perform contract calls, message signing, and asset approvals. These features are ideal for engaging with DeFi strategies, NFT marketplaces, and dApp authentication.

### Fully custodial with secure key management  
You donâ€™t need to manage private keys yourself. Cobo ensures keys cannot be exported and uses multiple layers of security to safeguard your assets. Even in cases of accidental approvals, the impact is limited to the affected address.

### Clear and flexible address-level control  
You can specify the source address for each action, which improves operational clarity, asset isolation, and audit readiness.

### Flexible fee handling  
You can customize gas fees, or enable [Fee Station](/en/portal/fee-station/introduction) to centralize gas payments and simplify operations.

### Seamless dApp integration  
You can integrate Web3 Wallets into dApps using Cobo Connect or WaaS 2.0 API. This provides a secure and convenient way to interact with Web3 applications without exposing your private keys.
