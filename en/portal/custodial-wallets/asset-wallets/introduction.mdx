Asset Wallets are a type of fully custodial wallet designed for the secure storage, transfer, and centralized management of digital assets. They allow you to manage funds across multiple blockchains and addresses in a unified manner, without the need to interact with smart contracts or perform on-chain operations. 

Asset Wallets help improve operational efficiency and control, making them well suited for day-to-day deposits and withdrawals, fund consolidation, batch processing, and multi-role collaboration.

## Key features

### Automatic token sweep  
Asset Wallets include a built-in token sweep mechanism that automatically consolidates funds from deposit addresses, helping reduce operational overhead and on-chain transaction costs.

### Built-in KYT compliance  
All transactions from Asset Wallets are automatically screened by Coboâ€™s KYT engine to meet regulatory and risk management requirements.

### Cobo Loop support  
Transfers between Asset Wallets can be settled instantly with zero fees using [Cobo Loop](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/asset-wallets/cobo-loop), making it ideal for internal fund movements and wallet coordination across chains.
