If you are experiencing difficulties in creating a new wallet, consider the below possibilities and corresponding solutions:

1. Limited user permissions
    - Problem: You may not have the necessary permissions to create a new wallet.
    - Solution: Ensure that you have the [required permissions](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) or contact your administrator.


2. Network issue / server downtime
    - Problem: Your network may be unstable or Cobo's servers may be under maintenance or temporarily unavailable.
    - Solution: Ensure that your network connectivity is stable and Cobo is not under maintenance. See Cobo's system status [here](https://status.cobo.com/).
