## Configure user roles and permissions

Cobo Portal offers extensive role-based access control capabilities for you to segregate duties and safeguard your assets and operations.

By assigning user roles to your team members, they will be granted permissions associated with these user roles, which decide what operations they can perform within your organization. Cobo Portal offers preset user roles, such as Admin, Approver, Spender, Operator, and Viewer. Alternatively, you can also customize your own roles to suit your unique business needs. To learn more about user roles and permissions, see [Introduction to user roles and permissions](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions).


## Configure transaction policies

As a part of the [risk controls](/en/portal/risk-controls/introduction), when a transaction is initiated, it undergoes a matching process against the [transaction policies](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview). If a matching policy is identified, the corresponding preset action will be executed, potentially resulting in auto approval, auto rejection, or the activation of an approval quorum.

To view the transaction policies associated with your wallet, click **View Transaction Policies** <img src="/images/custodial-wallet/view-transaction-policies.png" className="icon"/> in the respective wallet.

To learn how to configure the transaction policies, see [Off-chain transaction policies](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview).
