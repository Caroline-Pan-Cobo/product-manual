## What is Developer Console

Cobo Portal's Developer Console acts as the central hub, delivering a comprehensive experience for managing API keys, tracking API logs, overseeing webhook events, and handling callback messages. It serves as a one-stop solution for developers looking to control and optimize their workflows. This console provides real-time visibility into the organization's backend deployment actions, alongside extensive logs for debugging purposes. This ensures that developers have the necessary tools and information to maintain oversight and control over their organization's operations at all times.
