8. Select the wallets this API key has control over.
9. Select the key type. 
    - **Permanent**: To use this key type, you need to specify a static IP address as the address from which you send the API request. 
    - **Temporary**: A temporary key expires in 30 days. This option is suitable if you do not have a static IP address ready yet.

11. Click **Register**.


<Note>Depending on your organization's governance policies, you may need to obtain approval from your organization admin before the API key becomes active.</Note>
