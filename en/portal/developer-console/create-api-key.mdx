Register an API key following these simple steps:

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click the Developer icon <img src="/en/images/common/icon_developer.svg" className="icon" alt="the Developer icon" /> in the main menu.
3. Click the **WaaS 2.0** tab and then switch to the **API Keys** tab.
4. Click **Register API Key**.
5. Enter the API key name (maximum 30 characters).
6. Enter the API key and select its cryptographic algorithm. The API key is the public key in the cryptographic key pair, and must be 64 characters long, containing only numbers 0 to 9 and alphabets A to F. To learn how to generate an API key, see [Generate an API key and an API secret](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/overview/cobo-auth#generate-an-api-key-and-an-api-secret).
7. Select user roles from the drop-down list.
<Info>The API key will obtain the permissions listed under the user roles you select.</Info>
8. Select the wallets this API key has control over.
9. Select the callback endpoints this API key uses, or register a new one. The selected callback endpoint will receive messages triggered by the API key. For more information, see [Register a callback endpoint](/en/portal/developer-console/callbacks-register).
10. Select the key type. 
    - **Permanent**: To use this key type, you need to specify a static IP address as the address from which you send the API request. 
    - **Temporary**: A temporary key expires in 30 days. This option is suitable if you do not have a static IP address ready yet.
11. Enter the IP address to whitelist (separate between each IP address with a comma, if you have more than one IP address to whitelist).
12. Click **Register**.


<Note>Depending on your organization's governance policies, you may need to obtain approval from your organization admin before the API key becomes active.</Note>
