Webhooks and callbacks are essential mechanisms for the WaaS service to communicate with your application. After you set up and register callback and webhook endpoints, the WaaS service sends push messages to the designated URL when an event occurs. They allow your application to receive real-time updates or notifications and to respond to events accordingly.

Webhooks serve as real-time notifications for events such as transaction status updates. They are triggered when certain events occur such as transaction status or TSS request status changes, based on the event types to which you subscribe.

You can view the Cobo public key on the Webhooks page. This key is used to verify the signature of incoming webhook requests, ensuring they are sent by Cobo and have not been tampered with.

For more details about the webhooks and callbacks mechanisms and how to handle them, refer to [Webhooks and callbacks](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/introduction).
