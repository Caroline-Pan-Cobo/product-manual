5. Enter the URL.
6. Enter a description for the webhook endpoint.
7. Select the types of event notifications you want to subscribe to.
    <Note>For more details about the event types, refer to [Webhook event types](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/webhook-event-type#webhook-event-types).</Note>
8. Click **Register**.

Now you have registered a webhook endpoint. After registering the webhook endpoint, you cannot delete it. However, if it's no longer needed, you can revoke it, which will permanently disable its functionality. For more details on managing webhook endpoints, including how to revoke them, refer to [Manage webhook endpoints](/en/portal/developer-console/webhooks-manage).
