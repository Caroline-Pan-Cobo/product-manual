When you link a Deribit account to your Exchange Wallet, you will need to provide a client ID and a client secret of an API key. Besides, you also need to include Cobo in the IP whitelist and assign specific permissions to the key.

This article explains how to generate an API key on Deribit, including adding Cobo to the IP whitelist and setting permissions.
