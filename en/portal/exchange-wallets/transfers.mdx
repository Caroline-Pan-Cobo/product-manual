This article describes how to transfer assets to your Exchange Wallets.

## Transfer within an Exchange Wallet

Transfers within an Exchange Wallet refer to the following cases:
- From the Main Account to its Sub Accounts
- From a Sub Account to its associated Main Account
- From a Sub Account to another Sub Account of its associated Main Account

For these cases, refer to [Transfer from Exchange Wallets](/en/portal/transfers/from-exchange-wallets) for instructions.

## Deposit into an Exchange Wallet
Deposits into an Exchange Wallet refers to assets transferred from another Cobo wallet or an external address. You can only deposit into an Exchange Wallet (Main Account). If you want to add balance to an Exchange Wallet (Sub Account), you must first deposit into its associated Main Account, and then transfer the assets from the Main Account to the Sub Account. 

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
