When you link a Bitmart account to your Exchange Wallet, you will need to provide an API key, a secret key, and a memo. Besides, you also need to include Cobo in the IP whitelist and assign specific permissions to the key.

This article explains how to generate an API key on Bitmart, including adding Cobo to the IP whitelist and setting permissions.

4. In the **Memo** section, enter a memo in the field.
5. In the **Authority** section, select **Withdraw**.
6. In the **Binding IP Address** section, enter Cobo's IP address `18.177.234.7` and `18.180.16.190`.

If the API key is successfully generated, you can view an API key and a secret key. Carefully store the secret key, as it willl be displayed only once.

You have now generated and set up an API Key. You can go to Cobo Portal to link your Bitmart account with the API key, secret key, and memo. To learn how to link your account, see [Set up Exchange Wallets](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/set-up).
