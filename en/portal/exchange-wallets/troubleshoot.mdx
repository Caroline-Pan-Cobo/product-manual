## Unable to access your linked exchange account

A **“Connection Failed”**, **“API Not Found”**, or similar error message in your linked exchange account could be due to several reasons, such as API key expiration / deletion, insufficient API permissions, network issues on the exchange’s servers, exchange account suspension or restriction, KYC issues, etc.

To resolve this, click <img src="/en/images/exchange-wallet/24.png" className="icon"/> to re-establish the link. If the issue persists, check your exchange settings. Confirm that the network connectivity is operational, your API key is valid, has the necessary permissions, and is up-to-date, and your account status is active.

## Unable to link your exchange account

If you are unable to link your exchange account, please ensure the following steps have been done before trying again:

1. Whitelist Cobo IP (`18.177.234.7` and `18.180.16.190`) in your exchange's API settings, and ensure that the API key type and permission are correctly entered.
2. Ensure that the API key, secret, and passphrase are accurate.
3. Ensure that your exchange account status is active and has no pending KYC or other issues.
4. Verify that your internet connection is stable.
5. Confirm that the exchange is not down or under maintenance.
