    - For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com).

<img src="/en/images/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets/deposit.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>

5. Click **Copy Address** to copy the deposit address.
6. Proceed to your preferred external wallet to initiate the transfer to the deposit address you have copied.

#### Make a test withdrawal
1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
   - For testing, use the [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com).
   - For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com).

2. Open the **Transfer** dialog using one of these methods:
   - **Quick access**: Click <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button.svg" className="icon" alt="The transfer button" /> in the main menu of Cobo Portal

    <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button-location.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>

   - **From wallet**: Navigate to your wallet (<img src="/en/images/custodial-wallet/wallet-icon.svg" className="icon"/> > **Custodial Wallets** > **Asset Wallets** > _click your wallet_), then click <img src="/en/images/custodial-wallet/withdraw-icon.png" className="icon"/> next to the token you want to transfer. This automatically preselects the token and source wallet for you and you won't be able to edit them in steps 3 and 4 below.



3. For **Wallet Type**, select **Asset Wallets**. For the wallet address, select from the drop-down menu or search by wallet name, address, or label.

4. Select a **Token** and **Network** for the transfer. To enable a new token type, see [Add tokens](#2-add-tokens).

5. Select a **Recipient Address** from your Address Book or your wallets on Cobo Portal, or manually enter an address.
    
    - **Address Book** <img src="/en/images/common/icon_address_book.svg" className="icon" alt="Address Book icon" />: Only addresses associated with the blockchain network of the selected token will be listed.
    - **My Wallets**: Select a wallet type and then click on the specific wallet you would like to transfer to.
6. Enter the transfer amount.
    If this transfer can be executed as a [Cobo Loop](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/cobo-loop) transfer, a related information bar will appear on the UI as the following screenshot shows.

    <img src="/en/images/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets/transfer-panel.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Screenshot of the information bar" />

7. Review the transaction cost. Transaction cost includes network fees. You are unable to modify or customize this fee. The associated fees will be deducted from the selected **Source Wallet**, and it may differ from the token intended for the transfer.
8. <MySnippet2 />
9. Click **Submit**.
10. Approve the request on your Cobo Guard. If it is a new address not found in your Address Book or any of your wallets created on Cobo Portal, you will be prompted to add the address to your Address Book.

#### View transaction details and status
After making a transfer from your Asset Wallets, you can view its transaction status in <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **Transaction History**. The Loop icon indicates it was executed as a Cobo Loop transfer as the following screenshot shows.
<img src="/en/images/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets/transaction-history.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Screenshot of the transaction history" />

<Info>To learn more about making transfers from Asset Wallets, see [Transfer from Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets)](/en/portal/transfers/from-asset-wallets).</Info>

### 4. Set up off-chain transaction policies
Off-chain transaction policies help you automate transaction approvals and enhance security by defining specific conditions and approval requirements. These policies can include auto-approval, auto-rejection, or approval quorum requirements.

In this guide, we'll create a policy that requires 2-of-3 approval for large USDT withdrawals to non-trusted addresses. For other policy setups and advanced configurations, see [Set up token transfer policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer).

#### Set up a trusted receiving address list
First, create a list of trusted addresses that are pre-approved for withdrawals:

<Info>In our case, we will configure the system so that any large USDT withdrawals to addresses outside this trusted receiving address list will require multi-signature approval (2 out of 3 authorized signers).</Info>

1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
    - For testing, use the [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com).
    - For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com).

2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"/> > **Transaction Policies**.
3. Navigate to the **Address Lists** tab and click **Create List**.
<img src="/en/images/risk-controls/create-an-address-list.png" className="screenshot_full_screen"/>
4. Enter a unique name (max 30 characters) and click **Confirm**.
5. Select your new list, click **Add Address**, and enter your trusted addresses.
6. Click **Submit** and verify with your Google Authenticator code.

For more details on managing address lists, including batch uploads, see [Address list](/en/portal/risk-controls/address-list).

#### Create the transaction policy
Now, let's set up a policy with these security rules:
- Trigger: Withdrawals over 30,000,000 USDT to non-trusted addresses
- Action: Require approval from 2 out of 3 designated approvers

Follow these steps:

1. In Cobo Portal, go to <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"/> > **Transaction Policies**.
2. Click **Create Policy** > **Token Transfer**.
3. Configure the basic settings:
   - Enter a descriptive **Policy Name**
   - Select the **Applicable Wallets**
4. Set up the conditions:
   - Click **+ Add Condition**
   - Set **Condition** to **Amounts**: **Token Type** = **Priced Currency**, **Tokens** = **USDT**, **Amount** > **30,000,000**, **Frequency** = **Per Transaction**
   - Click **+ Add Condition** to add another **Condition** for **Receiving Addresses**: Select your trusted address under **Not in Address Lists** so any withdrawals to non-trusted addresses will trigger this policy.
5. Configure the approval requirements:
   - Set **Action** to **Approval Quorum**
   - Click **+ Select Approvers**, choose **Admin**, then click **Submit**
   - Set **Approvals from** to **2** (displays as **2/3 Approvers**)

<Note>This setup assumes you have 3 Admin members (see [Invite team members](#invite-team-members)). You can alternatively select any combination of **Users** or **User Roles** totaling 3 approvers.</Note>

6. Review and submit:
   - Click **Next** to review the policy
   - Confirm the policy order and click **Next**
   - Click **Submit** and verify with your Google Authenticator code

Your policy is now active and will require 2-of-3 approval for any USDT withdrawal over 30,000,000 to non-trusted addresses. For more policy configurations and use cases, visit [Set up token transfer policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer).

<img src="/en/images/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets/example-policy.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Policy Created"/>

## What's next
### Additional setups to experiment with

#### Set up governance policies
You can set up governance policies to define the number of team members needed to approve certain operations (e.g., delete a team member, modify member roles, freeze the organization). See [Governance policies](/en/portal/risk-controls/governance-policies).

#### Create custom user roles
In addition to the [preset user roles](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) provided by Cobo, you can also create your own customized user roles.
See [Create customized user roles](/en/portal/organization/create-customized-roles).

### Integrate with our API
If you need programmatic access to manage your wallets, consider using Cobo's [WaaS 2.0 API](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/overview/introduction). Our comprehensive [developer guide](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/custodial-wallets/get-started-asset-wallets) will help you get started with the API integration.
