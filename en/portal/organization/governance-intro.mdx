Governance policies determine the approval rules under which an operation will be approved or rejected. Approval rules include auto rejection, auto approval, approval quorum, and customized workflow. Governance policies are categorized into five types: Members, Organizations, Wallets, Developers, and User Roles.

Below is a table of all available governance policies within each category:
