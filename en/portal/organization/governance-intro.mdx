## Overview
Governance policies determine the approval rules under which an operation will be approved or rejected. Approval rules include auto rejection, auto approval, approval quorum, and customized workflow. Governance policies are categorized into five types: Members, Organizations, Wallets, Developers, and User Roles.

## Available governance policies
To see the full list of available governance policies, log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login), click the profile icon at the bottom left corner, and choose **Organization**. Then, click the **Governance Policies** tab, and click either of the **Members**, **User Roles**, **Organization**, **Wallets**, or **Developers** tabs to view the associated governance policies.

<Note>The default approval rule for all governance policies requires approval from at least 50% of the organization's Admin users. You can [modify these approval requirements](/en/portal/organization/governance-edit) to better suit your organization's needs.</Note>

## Crucial operations
The following table lists crucial operations in Cobo Portal, and it is recommended to configure two or more [Admins](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) for their approval.
