You can assign user roles to either new or existing members.

## Assign user roles to new members

To assign user roles while inviting new members:

1. Click the circular icon on the lower left of [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Navigate to **Organization** > **Members**.
3. Click **Invite Members**.
4. In the **Invite Members** dialog, select the appropriate **User Roles** for the new member.
5. Complete the invitation process by providing the rest of the required information and clicking **Submit**.

This method allows you to set permissions for new members before they join your organization.
