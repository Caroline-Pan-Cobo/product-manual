The organization admin holds the sole authority to temporarily suspend (freeze) an account at their discretion. This capability enables the admin to promptly address various situations, including security issues or internal audits, by temporarily limiting access to the account's features.

To unfreeze the account, the organization admin must contact Cobo's customer support. Please note that there is currently no self-unfreezing option available.
