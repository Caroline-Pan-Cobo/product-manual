User roles consist of predefined sets of rules that enable you to assign specific permissions to designated members within your organization. Cobo offers five preset roles, with the option to create additional roles tailored to your specific requirements.

| Preset User Roles | Permission Scope |

| Viewer            | - Default user role after account activation. <br/> - Read-only access to asset allocation and transaction history within the organization. <br/> - Not allowed to initiate any operations. |
| Spender           | - Initiate withdrawal transactions. <br/> - Same as Viewer otherwise. |
| Approver          | - Approve withdrawal transactions. <br/> - Same as Viewer otherwise. |
