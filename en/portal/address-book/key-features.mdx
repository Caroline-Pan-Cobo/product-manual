## Withdrawal address manager
Create a list of withdrawal addresses for easy access, eliminating error-prone manual entry during transactions. Locate your withdrawal addresses quickly by adding customizable labels, using the search bar, sorting, or applying filters based on networks or last modified time.

## Comprehensive audit trail
Track and review the detailed operation log (e.g., who added the withdrawal address, when it was added or modified, etc.), as well as the transaction history associated with each withdrawal address.
