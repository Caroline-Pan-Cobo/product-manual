## Install and open SuperLoop.

SuperLoop is a [Cobo Portal App](/en/portal/portal-apps/introduction) developed by Cobo. To install SuperLoop, follow the instructions in [Browse and install apps](/en/portal/portal-apps/browse-and-install) and install SuperLoop.

## Link exchange accounts

To link exchange accounts, click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="Icon showing the Apps tab"/> on [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login), find **SuperLoop**, then click **Open** to open SuperLoop.

When you open SuperLoop for the first time, you will be taken to the exchange account linking page. Click **+ Exchange Account**, select an **Exchange** and an **Exchange Account**, then click **Link**.

<Note> The Exchange Account (Exchange Wallets) you are trying to link to must have already been set up. See [Set up Exchange Wallets](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/set-up). </Note>

After you've linked at least one [Exchange Wallet](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/introduction) with SuperLoop, you will be taken to the SuperLoop main page that lists all of the linked exchange accounts:
