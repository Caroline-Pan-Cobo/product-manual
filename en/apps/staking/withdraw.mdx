<Info>Currently, the Staking App is available for [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) in [Organization-Controlled Vaults](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-mpc-vault) and supports staking BTC with the [Babylon protocol](https://babylonlabs.io/).</Info>

Babylon offers two methods to withdraw assets:

- Early unstaking: You need to [unstake](/en/apps/staking/unstake) (officially referred to as **unbond** by Babylon) first and then withdraw.
- Natural expiration: You can directly withdraw your assets without the need to unstake first.

Follow these steps to withdraw assets.

<Note>Prerequisite 1: You have unstaked BTC or BTC that has naturally expired in an MPC Wallet in an Organization-Controlled Vault. The wallet has not been moved out of [**Wallet Scopes**](/en/portal/portal-apps/app-settings) accessible by Staking.</Note>

<Note>Prerequisite 2: You need to have the [Staker](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role to withdraw assets.</Note>

1. Click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon"/> on [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login), find **Staking**, then click **Open** to open Staking.
2. Click **View** under **Actions** in the row of the protocol that you want to withdraw from.
3. Click **Withdraw** in the row of the staking position from which you want to withdraw. The **Withdraw** button appears only in the rows of the staking positions with the status **Withdrawable**.
4. Review the information in the pop-up window. Select a receiving wallet. For **Transaction Cost**, select from **Slow**, **Standard**, and **Fast** for **Network Fee**. You can also customize your fee rate by clicking <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/staking/setting.svg" className="icon" alt="The customize fee icon"/>. 
5. Click **Submit**. You need to have sufficient balance for the network fee to submit the transaction.
6. In the **Withdrawal Request Submitted** window, click **Staking Activity** to go to the staking details page.
7. On the staking details page, new records are created for the withdrawal.

    - Under **Staking Positions**, a record is created, and its **Position Status** is **Withdrawal in Progress**.
        - If the withdrawal succeeds, the **Position Status** becomes **Closed**. The assets are transferred back to your wallet.
        - If the withdrawal fails, the **Position Status** changes back to **Withdrawable**, and the **Withdraw** button appears under **Actions**.
    - Under **Activity**, a record is created, and its **Activity Status** is **Processing**. If the withdrawl request is rejected by risk control policies or signers, the status will be **Failed**; otherwise, it stays as **Processing**. When the transaction goes on-chain, the status will be **Success**.
        <Info> Withdrawal does not require confirmation from Babylon.</Info>
