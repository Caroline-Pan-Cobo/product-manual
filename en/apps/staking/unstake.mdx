<Info>Currently, the Staking app is available for [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) in [Organization-Controlled Vaults](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-mpc-vault) and supports staking BTC with the [Babylon protocol](https://babylonlabs.io/).</Info>

Babylon offers two methods to withdraw assets:

- Early unstaking: You need to unstake (officially referred to as **unbond** by Babylon) first and then withdraw.
- Natural expiration: You can directly withdraw your assets without the need to unstake first.

Follow these steps to unstake assets before expiraion.

<Note>Prerequisite 1: You have [stakec](/en/apps/staking/stake) BTC in an MPC Wallet in an Organization-Controlled Vault.</Note>

<Note>Prerequisite 2: You need to have the [Staker](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role to unstake assets.</Note>

1. Click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon"/> on [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login), find **Staking**, then click **Open** to open Staking.
2. Click **View** under **Actions** in the row of the protocol from which you want to unstake.
3. On the staking details page, click **Unstake** under **Actions** in the row of the staking position that you want to unstake. 

   - The **Unstake** button appears only in the rows of the staking positions with the status **Active** or **Limit exceeded**.
   - For Babylon, you can only unstake the whole amount; partial unstaking is not allowed.

4. Review the information in the pop-up window and click **Submit**. Note that the Babylon protocol does not support customizing your fee rate for unstaking. You need to have sufficient balance for the network fee to submit the transaction.
5. In the **Staking Request Submitted** window, click **Staking Activity** to go to the staking details page.
6. On the staking details page, new records are created for the unstaking transaction.

   - Under **Staking Positions**, a record is created, and its **Position Status** is **Unstaking in Progress**.
      - If the unstaking succeeds, the **Position Status** becomes **Withdrawable**, and a **Withdraw** button appears under **Actions**.
      - If the unstaking fails, the **Position Status** changes back to **Active**, and the **Unstake** button appears under **Actions**.
   - Under **Activity**, a record is created, and its **Activity Status** is **Processing**. If the unstaking request is rejected by risk control policies or signers, the status will be **Failed**; otherwise, it stays as **Processing**. Depending on whether Babylon confirms the transaction, the final status will be **Success** or **Failed**.
