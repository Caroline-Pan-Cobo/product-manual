## Overview

Token Swap combines two powerful features: **Bridge** for transferring tokens across different blockchains, and **Swap** for exchanging tokens within the same blockchain.

## Bridge
Transfer tokens across blockchains securely and quickly through our Bridge feature. With zero counter-party risk, you can move major tokens like BTC, USDT, USDC, and ETH between popular chains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and moreâ€”all within your Custodial Wallets.

To learn more about the Bridge feature, see [Introduction to Bridge](/apps/token-swap/bridge/introduction).

## Swap
Exchange tokens within the same blockchain through a streamlined, one-click process using our Swap feature. Get guaranteed quotes with no slippage, and let Cobo handle the execution and settlement on your behalf.

To learn more about the Swap feature, see [Introduction to Swap](/apps/token-swap/swap/introduction).
