<Info>The Earn app currently supports investing in USDC Sky Farm through [Custodial Wallets](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/introduction). Support for additional assets and wallet types will be added in future updates.</Info>

<Note>Prerequisite 1: You have an active investment in a product through your Custodial Wallet. The wallet has not been moved out of [**Wallet Scopes**](/en/portal/portal-apps/app-settings) accessible by Earn.</Note>

<Note>Prerequisite 2: You need to have the **Spender** role to redeem from products.</Note>

1. Click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon"/> on [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login), find **Earn**, then click **Open** to open Earn.

2. Click **Redeem** under **Actions** in the row for your invested product.
   - For the current USDC SKY Farm product, you can redeem any amount above the minimum requirement.
   - The redeemed amount will be returned to your original investment wallet.

3. In the pop-up window, fill in the amount you want to redeem. Review and check the box to agree to the terms and conditions.

4. Click **Submit**. Confirm the transaction in your Cobo Guard app.

<Info>Processing of large redemption requests may be temporarily delayed due to insufficient available funds or additional approval requirements. Processing will resume when funds become available or when approval is granted.</Info>

5. After you submit your redemption request, a new redemption record will appear under **Transaction History** on the investment details page.
