OTC enables you to seamlessly convert between crypto and fiat through licensed over-the-counter (OTC) providers. The app supports three types of transactions:
- Converting between crypto and fiat currencies
- Fiat deposits and withdrawals via bank transfers
- Crypto deposits and withdrawals using whitelisted addresses
