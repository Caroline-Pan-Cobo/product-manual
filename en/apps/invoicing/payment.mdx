After you send an invoice, your client will receive an email notification. This email includes key details such as the sender's name, the client's email address, the amount due in the specified payment tokens, and the payment due date.

The client can click the **View Details** link in the email to be directed to a page displaying the invoice details, as shown in the following screenshot. On this page, they can click **Pay Now** to make the payment.

If the payment is successful, the client will receive an email stating that the payment was successful, and you will also receive an email confirming the payment has been received.

If there is an issue with the payment, such as overpayment or underpayment, you will receive an email indicating a payment error. In such cases, please contact the Cobo invoice support team at [invoiceservice@cobo.com](mailto:invoiceservice@cobo.com).
