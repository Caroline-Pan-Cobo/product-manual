    - **Expected Payment Tokens**: Select one or multiple payment tokens. If you select multiple tokens, the payer can choose any one of them to complete the payment.

5. After you click **Create & Send**, it usually takes about 10 seconds for the payment link to be generated; then the invoice status will change from **Sending** to **Pending**. An email notification is sent to the client. For more information about the process from your client's perspective, see [Invoice payment](/en/apps/invoicing/payment).
