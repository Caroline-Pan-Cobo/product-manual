    - **Send Reminder**: Opens your default email client. You can manually send a reminder to the client.
    - **Void Invoice**: Provide a reason for voiding the invoice. You can view the reason later by clicking <img src="/en/images/common/icon_question_circle.svg" className="icon" alt="the question circle icon"/> next to the **Voided** status in the invoice list.
    - **Duplicate Invoice**: A new invoice ID will be generated. Select the **Payment Due** and **Issued On** dates. Other fields will be copied from the original invoice but can be edited.
