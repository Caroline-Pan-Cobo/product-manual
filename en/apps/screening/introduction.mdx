## What is Screening?

Screening is a [Cobo Portal App](/en/apps/introduction) that streamlines Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance through automated transaction monitoring. Using advanced Know Your Address (KYA) and Know Your Transaction (KYT) capabilities, it provides comprehensive protection for your selected [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) while your team focuses on business growth.

Once [installed](/en/apps/screening/set-up), the app continuously monitors transactions in real-time, providing intelligent risk detection and automated compliance controls.

## Key features

### Intelligent risk detection

Screening automatically analyzes transactions in real-time using advanced risk assessment technology through our integration with [CipherOwl](https://www.cipherowl.com/), a leading provider of cryptocurrency compliance solutions that ensures professional and reliable AML/CFT screening results.

The screening results include:

1. **Real-time scanning**: Instant analysis of transactions for immediate threat detection
2. **Smart risk classification**: Transactions are automatically classified into three risk levels (Low, Medium, High) based on CipherOwl's risk scoring system. For detailed information about these risk levels, please refer to [CipherOwl's Address Risk Score documentation](https://s.cipherowl.ai/Address-Risk-Score-1a0d90dd030f80b5904cd4aa76e15cea). You can then decide how to manage transactions based on their assigned risk levels.

<Info>
When a transaction in your [selected monitored wallets](/en/apps/screening/settings) is being screened, Cobo transmits the following transaction details to CipherOwl for risk assessment:
- Asset's chain
- From address (for deposits)
- To address (for withdrawals)
</Info>

### Automated defense and risk management

After Screening analyzes transactions, automatically handle them based on your configured post-screening policies:

- [**Post-screening policies**](/en/apps/screening/risk-policies#post-screening-policies):
  Define policies using these criteria:
  - Transaction direction (Inbound/Outbound)
  - Risk level (Low/Medium/High)
  - Amount range (Min-Max in USD)

- **Automated responses**:
  When a policy matches, automatically:
  - **Approve**: Allow transactions to proceed
  - **Approve with Alert**: Allow transactions with risk notification
  - **Reject**:
    - For inbound transactions:
      - Currently: Transactions are flagged
      - Funds will be frozen
    - For outbound transactions: The transaction is blocked
    - Risk notification is always sent
  - **Manual Review**: *Coming soon*

### Unified compliance dashboard

Manage all compliance activities efficiently through an intuitive timeline view that provides:

- Real-time risk assessment tracking and review status
- Transaction fund status monitoring
- Complete audit trails and action histories

This centralized timeline interface ensures all compliance activities and their histories are easily accessible in one place.
