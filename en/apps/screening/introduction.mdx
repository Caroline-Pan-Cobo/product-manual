<Tip>This Screening manual is written by its app developer (CipherOwl). If you have any questions regarding the documentation or the product, please contact CipherOwl directly.</Tip>

Screening is a [Cobo Portal App](/en/portal/portal-apps/introduction) maintained by CipherOwl. After [installing the app](/en/apps/screening/set-up), you can use it to scan all incoming and outgoing transactions for your [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction). The app provides notifications and scan result viewing, showing whether any transaction addresses have been sanctioned.

Sanction scanning rules automatically scan transactions to identify and flag associations with sanctioned entities, enhancing compliance with regulatory requirements. The system helps detect and prevent financial activities with prohibited individuals, organizations, or countries, thereby reducing the risk of legal and financial penalties.
