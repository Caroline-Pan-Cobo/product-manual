## What is Screening?

Screening is a [Cobo Portal App](/en/apps/introduction) that streamlines Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance through automated transaction monitoring. Using advanced Know Your Address (KYA) and Know Your Transaction (KYT) capabilities, it provides comprehensive protection for your selected [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) while your team focuses on business growth.

Once [installed](/en/apps/screening/set-up), the app continuously monitors transactions in real-time, providing intelligent risk detection and automated compliance controls.

## Key features

### Intelligent risk detection

Screening automatically analyzes every transaction in real-time using advanced risk assessment technology:

1. **Real-time scanning**: Instant analysis of all transactions for immediate threat detection
2. **Smart risk classification**: Transactions are automatically classified into three risk levels:
   - Low Risk: Typically lower-risk transactions
   - Medium Risk: Transactions that may need closer review
   - High Risk: Potentially high-risk transactions

### Automated defense and risk management

After Screening analyzes transactions, automatically handle them based on your configured post-screening policies:

- [**Post-screening policies**](/en/apps/screening/risk-policies#post-screening-policies):
  Define policies using these criteria:
  - Transaction direction (Inbound/Outbound)
  - Risk level (Low/Medium/High)
  - Amount range (Min-Max in USD)

- **Automated responses**:
  When a policy matches, automatically:
  - **Approve**: Allow transactions to proceed
  - **Approve with Alert**: Allow transactions with risk notification
  - **Reject**: Block transactions

  *Coming soon: Manual Review option*

### Unified compliance dashboard

Manage all compliance activities efficiently through an intuitive timeline view that provides:

- Real-time risk assessment tracking and review status
- Transaction fund status monitoring
- Complete audit trails and action histories

This centralized timeline interface ensures all compliance activities and their histories are easily accessible in one place.
