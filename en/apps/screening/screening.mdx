<Tip>This Screening manual is written by its app developer (CipherOwl). If you have any questions regarding the documentation or the product, please contact CipherOwl directly.</Tip>

Click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon"/> on [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login), find **Screening**, then click **Open** to open screening. 

Screening is an automated process. Once you [install the Screening app](/en/apps/screening/set-up), the system will automatically initiate screening for all inbound and outbound transactions. For inbound transactions, if the transaction address is sanctioned, the transaction will be flagged. For outbound transactions, if the transaction address is sanctioned, the transaction will be terminated.
