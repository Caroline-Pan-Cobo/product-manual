#### When using Elliptic

Elliptic has three different display styles depending on the scanning scenario:

1. **Address scanning with Entity as Unknown**
2. **Address scanning with a specified Entity**
3. **Transaction scanning**

### Timeline section

The timeline section provides a centralized interface to manage and track all compliance activities in one place:

- Real-time tracking of review status changes
- Transaction fund status monitoring
- Complete audit trails and action histories

### Available actions

The following actions are available based on the transaction's current status:

| Approve | • For inbound: Transaction passes AML screening, and the funds become available to the user.<br/>• For outbound: Transaction passes AML screening and proceeds to the next stage. |
| Approve with Alert | • For inbound: Transaction passes AML screening, and the funds become available to the user. An additional risk transaction notification is sent.<br/>• For outbound: Transaction passes AML screening and proceeds to the next stage. An additional risk transaction notification is sent. |
| Reject | • For inbound: Transaction fails AML screening, and the funds are frozen.<br/>• For outbound: Transaction fails AML screening, and the withdrawal is rejected. |
| Unfreeze | • For inbound: Releases frozen funds, making them available to the user.<br/>• For outbound: Not applicable. |
| Refund | • For inbound: Returns the funds from the receiving address to a user-specified address.<br/>• For outbound: Not applicable. |
| Isolate | • For inbound: Returns the funds from the receiving address to a user-specified isolation address.<br/>• For outbound: Not applicable. |
