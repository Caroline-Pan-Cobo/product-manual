## Overview

The swap feature allows you to exchange tokens through a single streamlined action. After you select the tokens to swap, the system provides a quote. Once you confirm the quote, Cobo handles pricing execution and settlement on your behalf. If you are using Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets), no signatures or on-chain interaction are required.

<Note><ul><li>Currently, only Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets) support the token swap feature.</li><li>Swap requests are processed by Cobo, so settlement may take some time depending on the underlying chains and liquidity.</li></ul></Note>

## Key features

### One-click same-chain swap  
You select the tokens to swap. After you confirm the quoted price, the system handles the rest, including execution and settlement. No signing, no approvals, and no complex workflows.

### Guaranteed quote with no slippage
Each swap uses fixed and all-inclusive pricing. Once you confirm the quote and submit the request, the transaction will be executed exactly as quoted. There is no slippage and no partial fill.

### Permission controls and auditability  
Your swap requests follow the same permission model, whitelisting, and risk control policies as other Cobo Portal operations. Every transaction is fully traceable from start to finish.

## Use cases

Swap is especially useful for the following scenarios:
- Balancing the amounts of different stablecoins on the same chain
- Acquiring native tokens for specific networks
- Preparing assets for other workflows, such as investments or staking
