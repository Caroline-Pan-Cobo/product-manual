Token Swap is a Cobo Portal App that provides two core functionalities:

- Bridge: Transfers the same token across different blockchains  
- Swap: Converts one token into another on the same chain

This document focuses on the swap functionality.  
<Info>For details on the bridge feature, please refer to the [bridge documentation](/en/apps/bridge/introduction).</Info>

## Overview

Swap allows you to exchange tokens through a single streamlined action. After you select the tokens to swap, the system provides a quote. Once you confirm the quote, Cobo handles pricing execution and settlement on your behalf. If you are using Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets), no signatures or on-chain interaction are required.

<Note><ul><li>Currently, only Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets) support the token swap feature.</li><li>Swap requests are processed by Cobo, so settlement may take some time depending on the underlying chains and liquidity.</li></ul></Note>

## Key features

### One-click same-chain swap  
You select the tokens to swap. After you confirm the quoted price, the system handles the rest, including execution and settlement. No signing, no approvals, and no complex workflows.

### Guaranteed quotes with final amount delivery  
Each swap uses fixed and all-inclusive pricing. You receive a guaranteed quote before submitting the request, and the exact quoted amount is delivered to your wallet.

### Built-in controls and auditability  
Your swap requests follow the same permission model, whitelisting, and risk control policies as other Cobo Portal operations. Every transaction is fully traceable from start to finish.

### Ideal for treasury operations  
Swap helps you rebalance stablecoins, acquire gas tokens across chains, or prepare funds for other Cobo Portal Apps like Earn.
