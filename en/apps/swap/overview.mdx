## Overview

Token Swap is a Cobo Portal App developed by Cobo. It provides two core functionalities:

- **Bridge**: Transfers the same token across different blockchains.
- **Swap**: Converts one token into another, potentially across chains.

This document focuses on the **Swap** functionality.

Designed for custodial wallet users, Swap enables seamless token conversions—whether within the same chain or across chains—through a single action. Users only need to select the source and target tokens; the system automatically determines whether a bridge is required and handles routing, pricing, and execution behind the scenes. There is no need to sign transactions, interact with smart contracts, or manage approvals.

By abstracting away the complexities of decentralized finance, Swap helps institutions securely manage and rebalance assets across chains, reduce operational steps, and maintain audit-ready transaction trails—all within a controlled environment.


<Note>
- Only custodial wallets are supported in the current release.  
- Initial token support focuses on stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC), with more assets to be added.  
- Users must ensure the relevant wallets and tokens are authorized before submitting a swap.  
- Swaps are executed non-atomically; Cobo handles settlement and delivery on behalf of the user.

## Key features

### Seamless one-step swap

Whether exchanging tokens on the same chain or across chains, users initiate swaps through a single interface. The system handles all underlying steps—bridging, slippage control, execution, and delivery—so users can focus on the end result, not the process.

This is especially valuable in custodial environments, where users may not have access to Web3 wallets or the ability to interact with smart contracts directly.

### Guaranteed settlement with fixed quote

Each swap is presented with a guaranteed "one-price" quote. Once confirmed, the execution is handled by Cobo, and the exact quoted amount is delivered. This helps reduce risk associated with price volatility and eliminates the need for users to manage partial fills or failed transactions.

This feature is particularly useful in time-insensitive treasury workflows, such as stablecoin rebalancing or preparing assets for investment.

### Native cross-chain support

If a swap involves different chains (e.g., Ethereum → BNB Chain), the system automatically includes a bridge step as part of the swap execution—no separate bridge operation is required. This simplifies cross-chain operations that would otherwise require multiple transactions and tools.

Cross-chain abstraction is helpful when acquiring gas tokens on new chains, or when repositioning assets across networks as part of treasury operations.

### Integrated risk and permission control

Swap respects existing organization-level security controls. All requests follow the same role-based permission system and Transfer risk control policies, including whitelist enforcement and transaction limits. This ensures consistent enforcement of internal compliance requirements.

This is critical for institutions needing predictable workflows and controlled execution environments.

### Transparent and traceable

All swap transactions include full metadata: request details, status updates, and execution timelines. Users and administrators can review each transaction’s history and confirm the outcome.

Combined with a clear fee structure—including slippage, gas costs, and platform fees—this supports auditability and internal cost attribution.
