## Supported Assets

The Token Swap feature currently supports a curated set of tokens for same-chain conversions. Each supported token is mapped to a specific chain and only available for swap within that chain.

This list will be updated as support expands.

### Ethereum

- USDC

### Arbitrum

- ETH
- USDT
- USDC

### BNB Chain

- BNB
- USDT
- USDC

<Info>Cross-chain swaps are not currently supported. To move assets across chains, please use the [Bridge](/en/apps/bridge/introduction) feature.</Info>

<Note>This list reflects supported assets for the Swap feature only. Token support may differ in other Cobo Apps such as Bridge or Earn.</Note>
