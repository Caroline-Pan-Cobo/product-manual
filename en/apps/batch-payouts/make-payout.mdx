4. In the **From** section, select the wallet from which the transfer will be made.
    <Note>Currently Exchange Wallets are not supported for a batch payout.</Note>
5. In the **Payout Details** section, specify the details for each recipient as follows:
    - **Receiving address**: You can enter addresses manually, or import them from your Address Book or an uploaded CSV file.
    - **Amount**: The transfer amount.
    - **Note**: Additional information about the transfer.
    - **Email**: A notification email will be sent to this email address when this transaction is completed.
6. In the **Transaction Cost** section, select a transaction fee level, or customize the transaction fee by clicking the settings icon <img src="/en/images/common/icon_advanced.svg" className="icon" alt="the settings icon" />.
7. Verify the transaction cost and click **Submit**.
8. Approve the payout on Cobo Guard.

Now you have submitted a batch payout request. 

## Next-Steps

After submitting the batch payout request, you can view the status and manage the batch or individual transaction. 

If the total payout amount is more than 100 USD, the payout triggers a workflow: its status will be **Pending Approval**. It requires one organization admin to approve, otherwise the transactions in the payout will not be proceeded. If no approval or rejection is made within 7 days (168 hours) after the payout is made, its status will automatically become **Failed**. For more details about the workflow, refer to [View and update workflows](/en/portal/portal-apps/workflow).

You can revoke the batch payout request before it is approved if you do not need it anymore. For more details about managing batch payouts, refer to [Manage batch payouts](/en/apps/batch-payouts/manage-payouts).
