This article describes how to manage batch payouts in the Batch Payouts app.

## Prerequisites

- You have [made a batch payout](make-payout).
- You have been assigned the [Admin](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role or a customized role with equivalent permissions.

## Steps
1. Click the Apps icon <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon" /> on Cobo Portal, find Batch Payouts, and then click **Open** to open the app.
2. On the overview page, you can find all the batch payouts listed. You can view the total payout amount, total number of transactions, and total number of used receiving addresses.

3. Click the corresponding icons in the **Actions** column to perform the actions as follows:
    - <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/batch-payouts/icon_cancel.png" className="icon" alt="the Cancel icon" /> (Cancel): Cancel a batch payout.
    - <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/batch-payouts/icon_drop.png" className="icon" alt="the Drop icon" /> (Drop): Drop a batch payout.
      Dropping a transaction will trigger a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction which is a new version of the original transaction. It has a higher transaction fee to incentivize miners to prioritize its confirmation over the original one. 
    - <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/batch-payouts/icon_speed_up.png" className="icon" alt="the Speed Up icon" /> (Speed up): Accelerate a batch payout.
      Speeding up a transaction will trigger a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction which is a new version of the original transaction. It shares the same inputs but has a higher transaction fee to incentivize miners to prioritize its confirmation over the previous one. 
    - <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/batch-payouts/icon_resend.png" className="icon" alt="the Resend icon" /> (Resend): Resend a failed batch payout.
      Resending a transaction initiates a new attempt to process the transaction that failed previously.

    | Action     | Applicable Transaction Status                      | Applicable Wallets Types                 |

    | Speed up   | Broadcasting                                       | MPC Wallets<br />Custodial Wallets (Web3)     |
    | Resend     | Failed                                             | All wallet types except Exchange Wallets |

	<Note>To perform the required actions on a batch payout, all the transactions in the batch need to be the applicable transaction status. Otherwise, the action will fail.</Note>

4. You can also click the **View Details** icon <img src="/en/images/common/icon_view.svg" className="icon" alt="the view icon" /> beside a batch payout to view details of individual transactions in the batch and perform the above-mentioned actions on specific transactions.
