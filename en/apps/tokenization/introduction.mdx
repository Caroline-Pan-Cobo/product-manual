Tokenization simplifies how you issue, manage, and operate your own tokensâ€”no technical expertise needed.

## Why issue your own tokens?

- **For asset/fund managers**: Tokenize the art, antiques, or real estate funds you manage to easily fractionalize shares, attract global investors, and increase asset liquidity.

- **For stablecoin issuers**: Quickly and securely issue and manage your own stablecoins to build an efficient and reliable settlement system for your ecosystem.

- **For exchanges**: Tokenize traditional financial assets like stocks to offer innovative investment products to your users.

## Key features of the Tokenization App

### Versatile token creation
Design and issue tokens tailored to your business needs, covering a wide range of use cases from stablecoins and security tokens to the tokenization of real-world assets.

### Complete lifecycle management
Securely mint, burn, upgrade, and pause your tokens. With role-based access control, you have precise command over permissions for every operation.

### No-code simplicity
An intuitive, user-friendly interface makes all token functionalities accessible, no smart contract development or coding skills required.

## How it works

### 1. Create your token
Easily create and issue your own tokens. You can also update token information as needed.

### 2. Manage permissions

#### Use blocklists and allowlists
Use blocklists and allowlists to control who can interact with your tokens.
- **Blocklist**: Addresses on the blocklist are prevented from performing any token operations.

- **Allowlist (Restricted Access)**: By default, all addresses not on the blocklist can transact freely. To enhance control, you can enable **Restricted Access** to activate an allowlist, limiting all token circulation exclusively to addresses that are on your allowlist AND not on the blocklist.

#### Assign permissions
Assign specific permissions to different wallet addresses. You can designate which wallets are authorized to perform certain actions, such as minting or pausing the token.

#### Monitor activity
View detailed information on token holders and track a complete history of all operations for transparent oversight.

#### Interact directly with the contract
A visual interface is available for direct interaction with the token's smart contract. You can call any public Read or Write function on the contract, covering both common features available in the UI and advanced operations for more complex needs.
