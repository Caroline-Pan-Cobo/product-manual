## Understanding bond tokenization

Bond tokenization is the process of converting traditional bonds or fund interests into digital tokens on a blockchain. This enables fractional ownership, increased liquidity, reduced settlement times, and enhanced transparency while maintaining regulatory compliance. 

For fund managers, tokenization creates new distribution channels and operational efficiencies while potentially broadening the investor base.

## Overview

Cobo provides an integrated infrastructure stack to help fund managers issue and manage tokenized representations of fund interests. Our comprehensive solution bridges traditional finance with blockchain technology, enabling secure, compliant, and efficient digital asset management.

**Our solution includes:**
- **MPC wallet infrastructure** for both investors and fund managers, ensuring institutional-grade security
- **Tokenization app** for smart contract deployment, whitelist management, and administrative control
- **Compliance-enforced token standards** (CoboERC20) that maintain regulatory alignment

**Key benefits for fund managers:**
- Enhanced security through MPC technology and compliance-enforced standards
- Streamlined lifecycle management of tokens (issuance, minting, burning, etc.) through a single interface, ensuring reliable alignment with off-chain legal ownership
- Reduced operational overhead through automated compliance controls enforced at the smart-contract level, such as allowlisting
- Improved investor experience with digital access and management

## Step-by-step workflow for EVM-based bond tokenization

### 1. Set up fund and create token

As a fund manager, you'll begin by establishing the foundation for your tokenized fund:

1. Establish fund structure and governance according to your jurisdiction's regulatory requirements.
2. Configure, deploy, and manage your token using Cobo's Tokenization app:
   a. **Create your token**: Define your token's core parameters (name, symbol, etc.) and set up critical access controls like operational permissions, allowlists, or blocklists.
   b. **Mint tokens**: After the token is created, you have the flexibility to mint tokens immediately or on-demand as investors subscribe.
   c. **Manage token lifecycle**: Manage all aspects of your token post-launch, including pausing the contract, burning tokens, and updating access controls in a comprehensive dashboard.

### 2. Onboard investors

As a fund manager, you'll guide investors through a compliant onboarding process:

1. Conduct thorough KYC/AML verification of potential investors.
2. Facilitate the signing of subscription agreements and token-specific disclosures.
3. Receive subscription proceeds directly to your fund's designated account.
4. Update your internal ledger with critical information:
   - Map investor name to their allocated fund units.
   - Associate wallet addresses with tokens to be issued.

### 3. Set up investor wallets

To receive and manage their tokens, investors can either:

1. Provide their existing wallet addresses
2. Use a secure and easy-to-use [MPC Wallet](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) on Cobo Portal

As a fund manager, you will verify all investor wallet addresses and manage their access using allowlist or blocklist in the Tokenization app.

### 4. Mint and distribute tokens

Once the off-chain subscription is finalized, you will use the Tokenization app to perform the on-chain issuance. This involves minting the exact number of tokens corresponding to the investor's subscription and distributing them directly to their verified wallet address. Each token serves as a digital representation of the investor's beneficial interest in the fund.

### 5. Manage ongoing token operations

**2.5 Token 持有与管理**

As a fund manager, you will provide ongoing management of the tokenized fund:

1. Enable investors to:
   - View token balances through Cobo's dashboard or integrated interfaces
   - Monitor Net Asset Value (NAV) updates through standard reporting channels
   - Submit redemption or transfer requests according to fund terms
2. Enforce access controls:
   - Maintain and update blocklist to prevent unauthorized transactions
   - Restrict transfers to allowlisted wallets only
3. Assign permissions such as minting, burning, and pausing to team members, or revoke permissions
4. Ensure continuous alignment between off-chain ledger records and on-chain token balances

### 6. Process investor redemptions

When investors wish to exit, as a fund manager, you will:

1. Receive and review redemption requests through your established channels
2. Approve eligible redemptions based on fund terms, liquidity, and lock-up periods
3. Instruct investors to transfer tokens back to your designated redemption wallet
4. Verify token receipt and confirm transaction completion
5. Burn the returned tokens through Cobo's platform to maintain accurate token supply
6. Update your internal ledger to reflect the cancellation of the investor's fund units
7. Transfer the redemption payment directly to the investor's bank account

## Conclusion

Cobo's Tokenization platform provides fund managers with a comprehensive solution for issuing and managing tokenized fund interests. By following these best practices, you can leverage blockchain technology to enhance operational efficiency, improve investor experience, and maintain regulatory compliance throughout the fund lifecycle.
