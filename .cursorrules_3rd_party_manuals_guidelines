# **Cobo Portal Apps - Product Manuals guidelines and templates**

After developing [Cobo Portal Apps](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/portal/portal-apps/introduction) using the [Introduction to Cobo Portal App development](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/apps/introduction) guide, it's beneficial to create product manuals. These manuals, like the [Invoicing manual](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/invoicing/introduction), enable users to understand your app's functionality, key features, and how to use it.

Cobo can host your product manuals on our [Product Manuals site](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/superloop/introduction) to enhance your app's visibility. Before publication, a Cobo review is required. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Write your product manuals in both American English and Simplified Chinese, and submit them as two separate files.
2. Deliver your manuals in markdown format, adhering to Cobo's template style. To download the template:
   1. Visit [Cobo's Product Manuals GitHub page](https://github.com/CoboGlobal/product-manual), click the green **< > Code** button, and select **Download ZIP**.
   2. Extract the "product-manual-master" folder from the downloaded ZIP.
   3. Navigate to product-manual-master/en/apps/invoicing to access the template files. The corresponding rendered page is available on [Cobo's product manuals page for Invoicing](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/invoicing/introduction).
3. Structure your manual following Cobo's format for other Cobo Portal Apps:

1. [Your app's name]
   - Introduction
   - How to use
     - Set up [Your app's name]
       1. …
       2. …
     - Manage [Your app's name]
       1. …
       2. …

[For example](https://manuals.cobo.com/en/apps/invoicing/introduction):

1. Include a Table of Contents in a markdown document named "TOC.mdx" that outlines your manual's structure (similar to 3-a above).
2. Provide your contact information so readers can reach you with questions or suggestions:
   1. Provider (e.g. Company name or main contact person's full name)
   2. Email address
   3. Any other contact details
3. Ensure your manual content adheres to the [Product Manuals content guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11SMXHFx6e-j0TaLcm6b75idemmj5Fa9p26y58Mb6YxE/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.pdfisrk405pt) for consistency and quality.
4. Ensure you follow the [Markdown special requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11SMXHFx6e-j0TaLcm6b75idemmj5Fa9p26y58Mb6YxE/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.vf2qujcgvbio) to meet formatting standards.
5. Use the [Cobo Portal EN <-> CN glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11SMXHFx6e-j0TaLcm6b75idemmj5Fa9p26y58Mb6YxE/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.riboun3abyvx) for accurate bilingual terminology when referencing Cobo-specific terms.
