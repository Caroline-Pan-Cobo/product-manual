Cobo Guard is a multifunctional security iOS application designed to enhance the safety and protection of your digital assets on the go. It serves as a transaction approval application, an MPC key share manager, a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method, and a passwordless login mechanism.

## Why Did We Design the Cobo Guard?
### Asymmetric Encryption for Asset Safety

This ensures that all operation approvals are signed by your private key and authenticated through the public key by Cobo.
