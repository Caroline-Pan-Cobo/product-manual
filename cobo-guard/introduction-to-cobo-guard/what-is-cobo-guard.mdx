title: What is Cobo Guard
---

Cobo Guard is a multifunctional security iOS application designed to enhance the safety and protection of your digital assets on the go. It serves as a transaction approval application, an MPC key share manager, as well as a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method and a passwordless login mechanism for Cobo Account.

## Why Did We Design the Cobo Guard?
### Asymmetric Encryption for Asset Safety
Cobo Guard utilizes asymmetric encryption to ensure the safety of your assets. Your public key is shared with Cobo, while your private key is securely stored in your iPhoneâ€™s native Secure Enclave. This ensures that all operation approvals are signed by your private key and authenticated through the public key by Cobo.

**Note**: We take security very seriously, and after careful evaluation, we determined that we cannot offer an Android version of Cobo Guard that meets our high-security standards.
