title: Generate and back up your key shares
---
To showcase how Cobo Guard can serve as a key share manager, this section guides you through the key share generation, backup, and restoration processes from the perspective of a key holder operating on a Cobo Guard app.

## Generate and back up your key shares
The key share generation process is initiated on Cobo Portal by an admin. The participants selected by the admin as key holders will receive a confirmation on their Cobo Guard to become key holders. Once all selected participants have confirmed to become key holders, key shares are generated on the key holders’ Cobo Guard. After the key shares have been generated, key holders can back up their key shares to iCloud using Cobo Guard.

### Initiate the key generation process
The key share generation process is initiated by the admins on Cobo Portal, and the keys would be categorized into one of the three groups: Main Key Group, Signing Key Group, and Recovery Key Group. We will use the Main Key Group to illustrate the process. (Link to content discussing Main Key Group, Signing Key Group, and Recovery Key Group in case the reader wants to learn more about them)

On Cobo Portal, admins would create a Master Key Group by clicking **(Wallets)** > **MPC** > **[Your Vault]** > **Create Master Key Group**.

During the Master Group creation process, the admins would select participants to become key holders. **Note**: Your Cobo Guard will have to already be bound to the admin’s organization for the admin to be able to select you as a key holder on this screen.

Once a Master Key Group creation is initiated by the admins, selected participants will be notified on Cobo Guard to confirm whether to become key holders.

As a selected participant, you will receive a notification on Cobo Guard to confirm whether to become a key holder. Tap the request to open the **Details** page.

On the **Details** page, tap **Approve** to confirm your willingness to become a key holder. You will need to authenticate yourself with Face ID.

When you see the **Approved** message, you’ve successfully become a key holder. You can confirm the status of this operation by tapping **All** on Cobo Guard’s main screen.

Once all selected participants have agreed to become key holders, the key generation process will start automatically. You will receive a notification on Cobo Guard to start generating key shares.
