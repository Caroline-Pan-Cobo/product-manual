title: Restore your key shares from iCloud

When you open the Cobo Guard app for the first time, you will be prompted to choose between **Restore MPC Key Shares** or **No Need to Restore MPC Key Shares**.

• Choose **Restore MPC Key Shares** if you have MPC key shares in your old Cobo Guard and need to restore them to your current app.

• Choose **No Need to Restore MPC Key Shares** if you are new to Cobo and either do not have MPC key shares to restore or do not require MPC key shares. You can skip this section if you plan on choosing this option.

**Note**: If you have MPC key shares to restore, please select **Restore MPC Key Shares** on this page now. Skipping this step will result in the failure to restore your MPC key shares.
