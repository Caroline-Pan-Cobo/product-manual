Follow the steps below to purchase a pricing plan.

1. Log into Cobo Portal.
2. Click the profile icon at the bottom left, and choose **Pricing Plans**.
3. Select a product. **Note**: If you want to use multiple products, you need to purchase a separate plan for each individual product.
4. Click **Upgrade**.
5. In the pop-up window that opens, select a pricing plan. If you are purchasing an Enterprise plan, discuss with the sales team about plan details before proceeding.
6. Complete KYC verification. This is required only if you are purchasing an Enterprise plan for Custodial Wallets or MPC Wallets. Follow the instructions on the screen to submit your KYC application. The time it takes to approve your KYC application can vary based on different factors, including your business and regional compliance policies. **Note**: If you have successfully completed KYC verification during a previous purchase, you will not be asked to submit the application for subsequent purchases.
7. Review and sign the service agreement. If you are purchasing an Enterprise plan, contact the sales team to review and sign the service agreement. Otherwise, you can review and sign the agreement on Cobo Portal directly.
8. If you are purchasing a Starter or Standard plan, select the billing cycle according to your needs.
9. Click **Pay** to make a one-time payment. If you are purchasing a Starter or Standard plan, you can also click **Subscribe** to set up an automatic renewal of the plan.
