To upgrade a pricing plan, follow the steps as introduced in [Purchase a pricing plan](/cobo-portal/bills-and-payments/purchase-pricing-plan/prerequisites).

There are a few additional considerations based on the specific upgrade scenario:

If you are upgrading to an Enterprise plan, you will need to contact the sales team to review and sign the service agreement. For Custodial Wallets or MPC wallets, you will also be required to complete KYC verification, if you have not done so in previous purchases.
If you want to adjust your existing Enterprise plan, you will need to contact the sales team to review and sign the service agreement.
