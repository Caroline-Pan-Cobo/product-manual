View your pricing plans
To view the pricing plans you are currently using, follow the steps below:

1. Log into Cobo Portal.
2. Click the profile icon at the bottom left, and choose **Pricing Plans**.
3. Select a product to see the corresponding pricing plan.


It iss recommended that you purchase add-on usages or upgrade to a higher-tier plan when one or more usages are nearing their limits. This will ensure uninterrupted service and avoid any potential disruptions or overage charges.
