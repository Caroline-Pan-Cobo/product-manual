## What is an Organization-Controlled Wallet?

Organization-Controlled Wallet is an MPC-based wallet where the management and control of the digital assets lie with the organization itself. By using MPC technology to break up the private key into shares, encrypt, and divide among multiple parties, organizations can securely safeguard while maintaining complete control of their own funds or their end usersâ€™ assets. Organization-Controlled Wallet utilizes a 2-2 signature scheme, where the organization and Cobo each hold a key share for transaction signing.

Organization-Controlled Wallets are created within an Organization-Controlled Vault. Each Organization-Controlled Vault corresponds to a set of root extended private key (essentially, the master private key in the MPC framework from which a series of child keys can be created). You can set up multiple vaults, and create multiple wallets under each vault to meet the specific requirements of your business.
