**Note**: In the unlikely event that Cobo Portal discontinues its services, you can reconstruct the root extended private keys corresponding to the vault by using an active Recovery Group. All private keys associated with the wallet addresses in this vault can be derived from these root extended private keys. User guides will be available soonâ€”please stay tuned for further updates!
