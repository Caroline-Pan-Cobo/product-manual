### What are MPC Wallets?

<u>MPC Technology</u>

Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is an advanced cryptographic technology utilized for key management on the blockchain. With MPC technology, private key shares are individually generated within separate secure environments, encrypted, and divided amongst multiple parties. These parties will jointly sign transactions without ever exposing their key shares or materializing a private key at any time.

This means that the private key that executes transactions never exists or lives in any one device at any point in time â€” rather, it is decentralized and held across multiple parties / devices. MPC technology ensures that no single party can unilaterally move funds, eliminating a single point of failure and making key theft and internal fraud and collusion much more challenging for malicious actors.

### <u>Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) and approval quorum</u>

A Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is a type of digital signature protocol used by MPC Wallets to enable distributed parties to jointly sign transactions. In the MPC-TSS setup, a flexible quorum approval scheme (''m out of n'' key shares) can be implemented. For instance, in a 2-2 signature scheme, two private key shares will be generated independently and both key shares will be required to sign each transaction.
