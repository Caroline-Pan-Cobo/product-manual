Cobo Portal offers two types of MPC Wallets: Organization-Controlled Wallets and User-Controlled Wallets.

### <u>Organization-Controlled Wallets</u>

In an Organization-Controlled Wallet, the management and control of the wallet lie with the organization itself. This setup allows organizations to securely custody and maintain complete control of their own funds or their end users’ assets.

An Organization-Controlled Wallet utilizes a 2-2 signature scheme, with the organization and Cobo each holding a key share for transaction signing.

### <u>User-Controlled Wallets</u>

In an User-Controlled Wallet, end users of the organization are given full control of their digital assets. In this setup, each end user of the organization holds their own unique private key share to their MPC Wallet.

With a flexible quorum approval scheme (''m out of n'' key shares), User-Controlled Wallets allow the organization to customize how transactions are signed. For example, under a 3-3 signature scheme, the organization, the end user, and Cobo each hold a key share and all three key shares must collectively sign transactions. Alternatively, a 2-3 signature scheme can be implemented, where the organization’s key share is held offline and utilized only in specific circumstances, such as disputes or critical events.

To integrate non-custodial MPC Wallets into your applications, a 2-2 signature can be implemented, where the end user and Cobo each hold a key share, while the organization holds none.
