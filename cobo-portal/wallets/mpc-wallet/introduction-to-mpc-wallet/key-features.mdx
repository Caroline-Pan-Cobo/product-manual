### <u>Flexibility in Key Share Management</u>
Choose from Organization-Controlled Wallets and User-Controlled Wallets based on your unique business requirements. Organization-Controlled Wallets allow you to safeguard and control your own treasury assets as well as your end users’ assets. User-Controlled Wallets allow you to integrate non-custodial wallets into your applications and provide your end users with the control over their assets.

### <u>No Single Point of Failure</u>
Cobo Portal’s MPC Wallets utilize advanced MPC technology to decentralize the private key, ensuring that the full key is never materialized at any point. To sign transactions, multiple key shares are required to jointly participate. This ensures that even if one key share is compromised, unauthorized parties cannot unilaterally access your funds.  MPC Wallets safeguard your assets from external hacks, internal fraud, collusion, and human errors, significantly reducing the risk of asset loss.

### <u>Robust Asset Recovery Capabilities</u>
With comprehensive backup and recovery mechanisms in place, Cobo Portal’s MPC Wallets ensure that you have access to your assets at all times – whether your key share is lost or compromised, or in the unlikely event of a system failure or service disruption. You can choose to manage the recovery process independently or engage the assistance of a third party disaster recovery service provider, such as an insurance company or security firm, for added peace of mind.
