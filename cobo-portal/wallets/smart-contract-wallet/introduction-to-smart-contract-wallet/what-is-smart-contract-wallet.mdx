Cobo's Smart Contract Wallets support a myriad of smart contract wallets, prominently featuring [Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;](https://safe.global/wallet) alongside other Account Abstraction-based smart wallets. At the heart of our initial launch lies the robust integration of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; with Cobo Safe, an adaptable role-based access control framework boasting unparalleled authorization customization. Seamlessly embedded as a plugin for Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;, the foremost multi-signature wallet across EVM chains, Cobo Safe provides unmatched access control. Delving deeper within the Smart Contract Wallets lies the flexibility to delegate EOA wallets such as Coboâ€™s Custodial Web3 Wallets or MPC Organization-Controlled Wallets to interact seamlessly with the smart contract ecosystem.
