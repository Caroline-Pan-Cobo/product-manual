Cobo's Smart Contract Wallet stands as a beacon of support for a myriad of smart contract wallets, prominently featuring Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; alongside other Account Abstraction-based smart wallets. At the heart of our initial launch lies the robust integration of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; with Cobo Safe, an adaptable role-based access control framework boasting unparalleled authorization customization. Seamlessly embedded as a plugin for Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;, the foremost multi-signature wallet across EVM chains, Cobo Safe elevates access control to new heights. Delving deeper within the Smart Contract Wallet lies the flexibility to delegate an EOA wallet such as Coboâ€™s Custodial Web3 Wallet or MPC Client-controlled Wallet to interact seamlessly with the smart contract ecosystem.
