1. On Cobo Argus, _select the same Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; as the one you imported into Cobo Portal_.
2. Switch to the **Transfer Settings** tab.
3. Click on **Authorize** next to the Authorizations section.
4. Select your delegate address from the drop-down menu.
5. You will need to add your delegate addresses to **My Addresses** on Argus. If you havenâ€™t done it yet, simply click on **Add Address** in the drop-down menu to complete this step.
6. Review your authorizations. For the authorizations to take effect, a multi-sig confirmation is required from Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; owners.
    - If you wish to let Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; owners review one or more requests in a batch, click on **+Add to Transaction Bundle**.
    - If you prefer Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; owners to review this single request, click on **Submit** instead.
7. Your delegate will be authorized with the on-chain transfer role once the multi-sig confirmation is complete. To view it:
    - On Cobo Argus, switch to the **Transfer Settings** tab and navigate to the **Authorizations** section. You will be able to see your delegate address and its authorized role as Argus Token Spender.
    - On Cobo Portal, switch to the **Delegates** tab. The status under Roles & Permissions will be auto updated to Argus Token Spender.
