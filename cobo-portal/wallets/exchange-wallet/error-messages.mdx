- **Connection Failed**

If you receive a “Connection Failed” error message, it indicates that there is an issue with the connection to your linked exchange account. This could be due to several reasons such as API key expiration, network issues on the exchange’s servers, exchange account suspension or restriction, etc.

To resolve this, click on [insert icon] **Retry** to re-establish the link. If the issue persists, check your exchange settings. Confirm that the network connectivity is operational, your API key is valid, has the necessary permissions, and is up-to-date, and your account status is active.
