- **Address Manager**: Create a list of addresses for easy access, eliminating error-prone manual entry during transactions. Locate your addresses quickly by adding customizable labels (up to 30 characters) to each address, using the search bar, sorting, or applying filters based on networks or last modified time.
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Track and review detailed operation log (e.g. who added the address, when it was added or modified, etc) as well as the transaction history associated with each address.
- **Permission-based Access**: Manage permissions to add, view, edit, and delete addresses in your Address Book based on user roles. Refer to Roles and Permissions [add link to this section] for further details.
- **Transfer Restrictions**: Easily select addresses from your Address Book when you configure risk policies in Policies [add link to this section], such as whitelisting or setting transfer limits.
