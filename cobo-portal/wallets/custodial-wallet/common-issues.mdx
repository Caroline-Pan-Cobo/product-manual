### <u>Unable to find token on the dashboard</u>

If your token is not displayed on the dashboard, please ensure the following steps have been done before trying again:

1. Verify that the token has been sent to the correct wallet address.
2. Ensure that you have manually added the token’s contract address.
3. Confirm that you have the correct token address. Token addresses can be specific to each network and must be accurate.
4. Ensure your Cobo Portal is up to date. Older versions may not support newer tokens or networks.
5. Refresh your Cobo Portal to resolve potential display issues.

If the above steps don’t resolve the issue, consider reaching out to Cobo's customer support for assistance.

### <u>Wrong deposit made</u>

In the event that you mistakenly deposit your tokens into an incorrect wallet address, these tokens will be irretrievably lost. Please always remember to double check before transferring your assets.
