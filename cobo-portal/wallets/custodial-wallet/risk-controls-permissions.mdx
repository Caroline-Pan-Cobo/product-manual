## Configure Roles and Permissions

Cobo Portal offers extensive role-based access control capabilities for you to segregate duties and safeguard your assets and operations.

By assigning roles to your team members, they will be granted permissions associated with that role, governing which parts of the platform they can access and what operations they can perform. Cobo Portal offers the following preset roles. Alternatively, you can also customize your own roles to suit your unique business needs.

import React from 'react';

export const PermissionsTable = () => (
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Role</th>
        <th>Permissions</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Admin</td>
        <td>
          Freeze Organization<br />
          Invite / Delete Member<br />
          Assign / Edit Member Role<br />
          Freeze / Unfreeze Member<br />
          Add / Edit Custom Role<br />
          Configure API & API callback<br />
          Set up risk control policies
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Operator</td>
        <td>Oversee & Manage all assets</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Approver</td>
        <td>Approve / Reject Transactions</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Spender</td>

## Configure Risk Controls

When initiating a transfer or contract interaction with your Custodial Wallet, you can set up an extensive variety of programmable risk controls on virtually any parameter within a transaction or operation to ensure its utmost security via Cobo Portalâ€™s **Risk Controls**.

Automate governance by configuring a set of granular rules that dictate how transactions are handled and approved for every wallet, user, and transaction type. You can create address whitelists and/or blacklists, set transfer limits for a single transaction or specific time periods, and control how transactions and operations are automatically processed - rejected, approved, or subject to specific quorum requirements.

To view the risk controls associated with your wallet, click on **View Wallet Policy** [insert icon] in the respective wallet.

To configure the risk controls, refer to <u>**Risk Controls** user manual</u> [insert link].
