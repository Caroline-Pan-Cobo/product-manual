## Configure Risk Controls

Initiating a transfer or contract interaction through your Custodial Wallet may be governed by a risk control policy. Cobo offers a variety of programmable risk control policies designed to safeguard your assets.

You have the ability to tailor the risk control policy by creating blacklists or whitelists for transactions, specifying conditions and control measures. For instance, implementing a “Transfer Limit” policy can mitigate the risk associated with daily withdrawals. It's important to set a threshold limit that aligns with your specific business needs, ensuring effective protection of your funds.

To configure the risk control policy of the selected Custodial Wallet, you may do so on the wallet interface by clicking on **View Wallet Policy** [insert icon].

For more details, please refer to the **Risk Control** [insert link] guide.



## Configure Roles and Permissions

The assignment of roles and permissions plays a crucial part in safeguarding your assets in the Custodial Wallet. It is vital to appropriately assign roles to team members that grant them the authority to execute sensitive operations.

Once a team member is designated a specific role, they are given permissions associated with that role. Prior to executing any critical operation, a verification of permissions is conducted. For example, if there is an intention to withdraw assets from the Custodial Wallet, the system first verifies if the user initiating the action possesses the requisite permission to do so.

To configure the roles and permissions of the selected Custodial Wallet, you may do so on the Cobo Portal interface by clicking on **Organization -> Roles**.

For more details, please refer to the **Organization** **(Roles)** [insert link] guide.
