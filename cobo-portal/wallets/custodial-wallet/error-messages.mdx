### <u>Unable to create wallet</u>

If you are experiencing difficulties in creating a new wallet, there could be several reasons behind this issue. Here's a list of potential causes:

1. **User Account Limitations**: If you are using a restricted user account on Cobo Portal, you might not have the necessary permissions to create a new wallet.
2. **Limited User Quota**: If you are using a restricted user account on Cobo Portal, you might have reached the maximum limit of wallets you are able to create.
3. **Invalid Wallet Name**: Errors made while inputting your Wallet Name (like unsupported symbols) can lead to failures in creating a new wallet.
4. **Server Downtime**: Cobo's servers might be down for maintenance or experiencing technical issues.
