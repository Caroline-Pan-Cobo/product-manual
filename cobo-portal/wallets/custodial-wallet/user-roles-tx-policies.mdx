## Configure transaction policies

When initiating a transfer or contract interaction with your Custodial Wallet, you can set up an extensive variety of programmable transaction policies on virtually any parameter within a transaction or operation to ensure its utmost security via Cobo Portalâ€™s **Transaction Policies**.

Automate governance by configuring a set of granular rules that dictate how transactions are handled and approved for every wallet, user, and transaction type. You can create address whitelists and/or blacklists, set transfer limits for a single transaction or specific time periods, configure approval workflows, and control how transactions and operations are automatically processed - rejected, approved, or subject to specific quorum requirements.

To view the transaction policies associated with your wallet, click on **View Transaction Policies** [insert icon] in the respective wallet.
