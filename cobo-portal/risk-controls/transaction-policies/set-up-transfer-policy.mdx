### <u>Create a transfer policy</u>

1. Log into Cobo Portal.
2. Click **Wallets** > **Transaction Policies** in the main menu on the left hand side.
3. Click **Create Policy** > **Transfer**.
4. Enter a name for the policy. The name should not exceed 30 characters.
5. Select all the wallets that are applicable to the policy you are about to create.
6. Click **+Add condition** to select a condition template. You can add one or more conditions to each policy. If multiple conditions are applied, the policy will be triggered only if the transaction satisfies all conditions. Refer to the [Select condition templates](/cobo-portal/risk-controls/transaction-policies/set-up-transfer-policy#select-condition-templates) section below for more information.<br/>
&emsp;a. You have the option to skip setting any conditions and proceed directly to the next step. This means that any token transfers associated with the applicable wallets will trigger this policy.
7. Select the action to be taken if the policy is triggered (i.e., auto approval, auto rejection, quorum, custom workflow). Refer to the [Set quorum approvals](/cobo-portal/risk-controls/transaction-policies/set-up-transfer-policy#set-quorum-approvals) section below for more information.
8. Adjust and review the priority of your policies. Transactions will be matched with policies in the list based on their priority order.
Once a higher-priority policy is triggered, subsequent policies will no longer be triggered.
By default, the newly created policy will be placed at the top of the policy list and highlighted. You can change the order by dragging and dropping.
9. Click **Submit** and, if required, complete the 2FA verification.

### <u>Select condition templates</u>
