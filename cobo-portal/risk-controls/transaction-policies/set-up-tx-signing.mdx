### <u>Create a transaction-signing policy</u>

1. Log into Cobo Portal.
2. Click **Wallets** > **Transaction Policies** in the main menu on the left hand side.
3. Click **Create Policy** > **Sign Transactions**.
4. Enter a name for the policy. The name should not exceed 30 characters.
5. Select all the wallets that are applicable to the policy you are about to create.
6. Select a blockchain network that is applicable to the policy you are about to create.
7. Click **+Add condition** to select a condition template. You can add one or more conditions to each policy. If multiple conditions are applied, the policy will be triggered only if the transaction satisfies all conditions. Refer to the [Select condition templates](/cobo-portal/risk-controls/transaction-policies/set-up-tx-signing#select-condition-templates) section below for more information. <br/>
&emsp;a. You have the option to skip setting any conditions and proceed directly to the next step. This means that any transaction signing associated with the applicable wallets will trigger this policy.
8. Select the action to be taken if the policy is triggered (i.e., auto approval, auto rejection, quorum, custom workflow). Refer to the [Set quorum approvals](/cobo-portal/risk-controls/transaction-policies/set-up-tx-signing#set-quorum-approvals) section below for more information.
9. Adjust and review the priority of your policies. Transactions will be matched with policies in the list based on their priority order.<br/>
&emsp;a. Once a higher-priority policy is triggered, subsequent policies will no longer be triggered.<br/>
&emsp;b. By default, the newly created policy will be placed at the top of the policy list and highlighted. You can change the order by dragging and dropping.
10. Click **Submit** and, if required, complete the 2FA verification.

### <u>Select condition templates</u>

**Initiators**: The policy will be triggered only if the transaction is initiated by designated parties. You can choose between API initiators or web initiators.
- API Initiators: You can specify whether any team members, or only specific members, are allowed to initiate transactions via APIs.
- Web Initiators: You can specify whether any team members, or only specific members, are allowed to initiate transactions via the web console.

**Token Transfer**: The policy will be triggered only if a token transfer is associated with specific token types, amounts, and frequencies.
- Token: You can specify the types of tokens available for transfers. If you do not see the tokens you would like to transfer, click the **plus icon** to manually add them.
- Receiving Addresses: You can specify the receiving addresses for the transfer. Note that you can only select addresses already added to the address lists. See Address lists for more information.
- Transfer Limit: You can specify the maximum transfer amount per transaction or within a specified time window.

**Token Approval**: The policy will be triggered only if a token approval is associated with specific types of tokens, spenders, and amounts.
- Tokens: You can specify the types of tokens the spenders are allowed to spend.
- Spender Addresses: You can specify the spender addresses associated with the token approval. Note that you can only select addresses already added to the address lists. See Address lists for more information.
- Amount: You can specify the maximum amount for the spender to spend, either per transaction or within a specified time window.

**Contract Call**: The policy will be triggered only if a smart contract call meets the specified criteria. You can select granularity at the contract-level, method-level, or parameter-level.
- Contract-level: You can specify the smart contract addresses for the call. The policy will be triggered when the "to" address of the contract call matches one of the specified addresses. Please note that you will need to manually enter the contract addresses.
- Method-level: You can specify the smart contract address and methods for the call. The policy will be triggered if both the "to" address and one of the call methods match the specified criteria.<br/>
&emsp;- If the displayed methods are incorrect, you can obtain the Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI) from the blockchain explorer or manually enter an ABI.
- Parameter-level: You can specify the smart contract address, method, and parameter(s) for the call. The policy will be triggered only if the contract call address, method, and parameter(s) match the specified criteria.<br/>
&emsp;- To add one parameter, click **Create**.<br/>
&emsp;- To add multiple parameters, click **+ Add parameter** in the pop-up window. If you would like to add a Boolean group, click **+ Add group**.<br/>
&emsp;- The relationship between parameters within the same group defaults to "And" and can be switched to "Or" by clicking.<br/>
&emsp;- The relationship between different groups defaults to "Or" and can be switched to "And" by clicking.<br/>
&emsp;- You can configure the condition templates through the interface or manually enter condition expression statements by clicking **Switch to expert mode**.

### <u>Set quorum approvals</u>

Currently, four types of actions can be taken if a policy is triggered:

**Auto approval**: Transactions meeting the above conditions will be automatically approved.<br/><br/>
**Auto rejection**: Transactions meeting the above conditions will be automatically rejected.<br/><br/>
**Quorum**: Transactions meeting the above conditions will require a specified number of approvals to proceed. Please click **+Add approvers** to add one or more team members as approvers. You can choose by role types or member names. Then, set the approval threshold.<br/><br/>
**Custom workflow**: Click **+Set workflow** to configure a custom workflow and enhance the flexibility of your action strategies.
