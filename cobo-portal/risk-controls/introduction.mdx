## What are risk controls?

On Cobo Portal, risk controls encompass a set of strategies tailored to managing and mitigating risks associated with digital asset transactions and custody. These controls are executed through three distinct methods:

1. [Transaction policies](/cobo-portal/risk-controls/transaction-policies/types-of-tx-policies).: You can select from three different types of off-chain transaction policies. Additionally, you can implement customized approval rules, such as auto approval and auto rejection, to streamline workflow processes.

2. [Governance policies](/cobo-portal/organization/security/overview2).: You can define the number of organization admins required to review certain actions, such as deleting a team member or freezing an organization. Moreover, you can implement customized approval rules, including auto approval and auto rejection.

3. [User roles and permissions](/cobo-portal/organization/security/overview1): You can assign specific roles to designated team members. Currently, Cobo Portal provides five preset roles, with the flexibility to create additional roles to tailor to your specific requirements.
