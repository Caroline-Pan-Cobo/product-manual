You can set up governance policies to define the number of team members needed to approve certain actions (e.g., delete a team member, modify member roles, freeze the organization). Depending on the action, the default rule mandates approvals from at least 50% of the admins or approval by one of the admins. You can also manually edit the rule to be auto approval, auto rejection, approval quorum, or custom workflow. See [**Governance policies**](/cobo-portal/organization/security/overview2) for more information.
