The organization admin possesses the exclusive authority to temporarily suspend (freeze) the account at their discretion. This allows the admin to respond swiftly to various situations, such as security concerns or internal audits, by restricting access to the account's features temporarily.

To reactivate (unfreeze), the organization admin must reach out to Cobo's customer support (option for self-unfreezing is not available at this time).
