1. Select the token type for the transfer. Selection is limited to tokens included in your organization's subscription package. To enable a new token type, click **Not enabled**. Please note that additional fees will apply.
2. In the drop-down menu under ‘From’, select **Custodial Wallet (Asset Wallet)**.
3. To find your wallet, click the text box or enter the wallet name. Custodial Wallet (Asset Wallet) created via both Cobo Portal Web and API will be listed.
4. Select a ‘To’ address from the Address Book on Cobo Portal, any of the wallets featured on Cobo, or manually enter an external address.
    - **Address Book**: Only addresses associated with the chain where the selected token is located will be listed. This may include external addresses manually added by the user or Cobo wallet addresses.
    - **My Wallet**: Select a wallet type and then search for the wallet.
    - **Other**: Manually enter an external address as the destination address (i.e., ‘To’). If it is a new address not from the Address Book or any of your Cobo wallets, you will be prompted to add the address to the Address Book.
5. Enter the transfer amount.
6. Review the transaction cost.
    - The fee is determined by the prevailing conditions of the blockchain network. Users are unable to modify or customize this fee. The associated gas tokens will be deducted from the selected "From" address, and they may not necessarily be of the same type as those intended for the transfer.
