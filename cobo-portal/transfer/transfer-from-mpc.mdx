    - EVM  chains: For EVM chains, transaction fees vary between the _EIP1559_ and _Legacy_ methods.
        - EIP 1559
            - Under the EIP1559 method, users can customize 3 parameters: max fee, max priority fee (gwei), and gas limit.
            - The estimated fee is calculated by multiplying the max fee by the gas limit: (max fee x gas limit).
            - For Mantle and Optimism, the displayed fee amount pertains to Layer 2 only. After you submit the transaction, Layer 1 fees will be auto deducted from your source wallet address. Please ensure that your address has sufficient gas tokens to cover all fees.
