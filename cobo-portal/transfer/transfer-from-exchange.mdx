1. Select the token type for the transfer. Selection is limited to tokens included in your organization's subscription package. To enable a new token type, click **Not enabled**. Please note that additional fees will apply.
2. In the drop-down menu under ‘From’, select **Exchange Wallet**.
3. To find your exchange account, click the text box or enter a wallet name. All exchange accounts linked through Cobo Portal Web and API will be displayed.
    - Note that transfers between Sub Accounts are not allowed. For such transfers, use the Withdraw function instead.
    - Assets in the Sub Accounts can only be transferred to the Main Accounts within the same exchange.
4. Select a ‘To’ address from the Address Book on Cobo Portal, any of the wallets featured on Cobo, or manually enter an external address.
    - Note that the selected exchange may require a whitelisted address as the ‘To’ address.
    - Only certain exchange account types allow funds to be transferred out from Main Accounts to an account other than the Sub Accounts on the same exchange. The following exchange account types permit fund withdrawals to an external address:

      | Exchange | Account Type    |
      | -------- | --------------- |
      | Binance  | Spot Account    |
      | OKX      | Funding Account |
      | Deribit  | N/A             |
      | Bybit    | Fund Account    |
      | Gate.io  | Spot Account    |

5. Enter the transfer amount.
6. Review the transaction cost.
    - For transfers between Main Accounts and Sub Accounts on the same exchange, no fees will be incurred.
    - For transfers between Main Accounts and an account other than the Sub Accounts on the same exchange, a fixed fee applies, which cannot be modified by the user. The fee token corresponds to the withdrawal token type.
