1. Select the token type for the transfer. Selection is limited to tokens included in your organization's subscription package. To enable a new token type (fees apply), click **Not enabled**.
2. In the drop-down menu under ‘From’, select **Exchange Wallet**.
3. To find your exchange account, select it from the drop-down menu or search by the wallet name. All exchange accounts linked through Cobo Portal Web and API will be displayed.
   - Main Account: All deposits and withdrawals can only be done on the Main Account.
   - Sub Account: To fund a Sub Account, transfer funds into your Main Account and then to your Sub Account. To withdraw from a Sub Account, transfer funds to your Main Account and then to your destination address.
   - Trading account types: Different exchanges offer different trading account types. Transfers from / to these trading accounts can only be done with their associated Main Account.
   - Notes (based on exchanges’ guidelines on transfers):
        - Transfers from Sub Account to Sub Account are not allowed by the exchanges.
        - Transfers from Main Account to Main Account may incur on-chain fees, which are determined and charged by the exchanges.
        - Transfers from Sub Account to Main Account are considered "internal transfers" and are not subject to fees by the exchanges.
        - Transfers to external wallet addresses are only allowed from Main Accounts and not from Sub Accounts.
        - Transfers to external wallet addresses are only allowed from the following account types:

            | Exchange | Account Type    |
            | -------- | --------------- |
            | Binance  | Spot Account    |
            | OKX      | Funding Account |
            | Deribit  | N/A             |
            | Bybit    | Fund Account    |
            | Gate.io  | Spot Account    |

4. Select a "To" address from your Address Book or a wallet on Cobo Portal, or manually input an external address. Note that the selected exchange may require a whitelisted address as the "To" address.
5. Enter the transfer amount.
6. Review the transaction cost.
    - For transfers between Main Accounts and Sub Accounts on the same exchange, no fees will be incurred.
    - For transfers between Main Accounts and an account other than the Sub Accounts on the same exchange, a fixed fee applies, which cannot be modified by the user. The fee token corresponds to the withdrawal token type.
