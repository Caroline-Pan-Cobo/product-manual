The Transfer module is meticulously designed to streamline the movement of assets within, into, and out of the four wallet types available on Cobo Portal. These encompass Custodial Wallet, MPC Wallet, Smart Contract Wallet, and Exchange Wallet. Currently, Cobo Portal supports the following transfer scenarios:


1. Transfer from Custodial Wallet (Asset Wallet), MPC Wallet (Organization-Controlled Wallet), Smart Contract Wallet (Safe{Wallet}), or Exchange Wallet to an external address.
2. Transfer between Custodial-Asset Wallet, MPC Wallet (Organization-Controlled Wallet), Smart Contract Wallet (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;), and Exchange Wallet.
3. Transfer between Main Accounts and Sub Accounts within the same exchange.

To make a transfer, click the **plus icon** in the main menu on the left hand side and fill in the required information as follows:

- **Token**: Select the token for transfer and review its network details.
- **From**: Select the source wallet address.
- **To**: Select the destination wallet address.
- **Amount**: Enter the amount to be transferred.
- **Available**: Balance available for transfer in the source wallet address.
- **Transaction Cost**: Fees associated with the transaction, such as network fees.
- **Category (Optional)**: Add up to 5 custom categories to easily identify your transactions.
- **Description (Optional)**: Add a description for the transfer.
- **Memo/Tag (Optional)**: For transfers out of Cobo Portal, it is highly recommended to include a memo/tag for the following chains: XRP, EOS, XLM, IOST, BNB_BNB, ATOM, LUNA, and TON.

Note: Loop Alliance and Gas Station are currently not supported by the Transfer module.
